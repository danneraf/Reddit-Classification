# Am I The Asshole for posting in the wrong subreddit?
#### YTA

Reddit has thousands of subreddits for people to post in for many different topics: games, politics, stocks, and more importantly: advice.

Am I The Asshole and Relationship Advice are two subreddits meant for people to share posts about their situations and ask for people's opinions/advice. Though you can find similar sounding posts on both subreddits, the subreddits are meant for different reasons.

In a way they are similar because people share interpersonal conflicts, especially in relationships. 
Both subreddits have certain rules for what you can share there, meaning what AITA may allow, Relationship Advice may not. For example, Relationship Advice requires posts to be about a *current* issue, whereas someone could post on AITA about something that happened 10 years ago. 

The responses people give on the posts can contain advice, but the responses expected are different. AITA has a voting system to determine who is the asshole, and Relationship Advice responses are meant to help someone with their issue at the moment. 

Both subreddits have commenters analyzing the posted situations and providing their opinions, both include posts about current situations, and both include posts about relationships.

Posting the issue you'd like advice for in the wrong subreddit could result in unhelpful comments, or your post not being approved to begin with.
