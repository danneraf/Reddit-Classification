relationship_advice,"
My boyfriend (28M) and I (24F) started dating this year and we're set to get married next year. We were actually set up by our families and have been in a long-distance relationship since the beginning. We talk every day for two hours after my work shift, but I sometimes find him too clingy and myself too detached.

He thinks I ignore him when I don't respond to his messages right away, but it's not intentional. I'm just busy or distracted sometimes. I'm also naturally a distant person, which makes it hard for me to express my feelings to him. I've tried to communicate this to him before, but it just led to disappointment.

I'm an introvert and he's very extroverted, so sometimes it's hard for me to keep up with his talking. I love listening to him, but I don't always have a lot to share myself.

I have to admit, my previous heartbreaks have made me put up walls around my heart, making it difficult for me to give my 100% sometimes. But I really want to make this work because I do love him and see him as my best friend for life.

How do I navigate my introversion and his clinginess without disappointing him?

relationship_advice,"i (24f) and my bf (25m) used to live together since 2018 until the day we broke up in october 2022.

during the course of the relationship, we've had various ups and downs. he is suicidal, depressed, and also has anxiety. we used to fight over the smallest of things and the fights would escalate into a physical one. i hit him, he hits me. it was a very toxic relationship but we had so many things in common that the relationship lasted for almost five years.

since we broke up, i found the freedom, well, freeing. but i got in touch with him again. i was adamant about staying single but he said he would just kill himself if we don't end up together. he literally said ""can't you see i'm crying out for help"" but the help he wants, what would save his life, is me sacrificing my freedom. i obviously don't want him to die, i love him. so i got back with him. but i've told him i cannot move in with him again. he was okay with that.

just yesterday we were together at his house (i came over) and he said he cannot bear being away from me again, and asked i move in with him. i said yes because he was on the verge of being way too depressed again. i said yes even though i haven't given it much thought yet.

but i'm sitting here torn. i don't want to move in with him, i'm not ready for that. but if i tell him that he's going to say i lied to him, and his emptions would probably spiral out of control again. i don't want to hurt him. but at the same time i don't wanna move in with him knowing i wanted something else.

relationship_advice,"Last night he had a work event and was out late, no red flags there, but he came home by subway and instead of coming to the house he stopped at the atm close by and took the car out, and was gone for about an hour, got into a fender bender. And wouldn't talk about why he was driving other than
""to clear his head"" we have street parking. No one drives at 2 am to clear their head to risk not having a parking spot when they get back. I admit I stayed awake until he passed out and did some snooping.
He called like 10 different numbers around 1:30
which is about when he took out $400 cash from the atm. now around 5am one of those numbers started texting him, asking for money for sexual services. I could see the destination he put in his gps and know for a fact he went there. When I confronted he came clean and admitted to calling different numbers from a shady ""escort"" website.
And going to the address on his phone but chickening out once he walked through the door. All the cash is accounted for, the amount of time between when he would have been at the place and when the car accident happened was about 15 minutes so I believe that, but I'm so angry that he's trying act like that's the part I should focus on like he did something honorable by backing out. I'm livid, I feel disrespected, disgusted, and heart broken. The icing on the cake is he is now getting death threats from the sex workers pimp who has managed to get a list of all of our family names. I'm a mess.

relationship_advice,"English isn't my first language, sorry.. 
We have been together for nearly 4 years, it's my second long term relationship and her first one ever. 
We talked about this subject in the past, but it wasn't anything serious, just some joking from time to time. I never said specifically that I don't want them ever, but was always on the ""probably not"" side of the party. 
I thought she knows that. 
Lately I decided to talk to her about this just to make sure we are on the same page. With the time that has passed I decided that now I'm 99.99% sure that I want to live a childfree life. And it was at this moment that she told me she always was on the ""probably yes, not now but in the future"" side. 
And she told me she thought I know that. 
We had some arguments since then, not angry ones but the sad ones. She told me ""I want kids with you but/and I don't want to lose you"". 

She suggested for us to just ""be happy"" and live just as we used to, because she doesn't fully know yet and ""I can't make her decide now because she doesn't know herself"". 

I don't know what to, we truly love each other, she's ""my person"", but ""the talk"" happened like 3-4months ago and I feel like a wreck of a man since then. I just can't shake off the feeling that everything that I do from day to day is pointless because it probably has an end point. THE potential end point surely doesn't help either. 
I don't know if she really doesn't know and just wants to see if that life (the one we had for a while, without kids) is for her, or she hopes inside that I will change my mind. Or worse, is pretty much blinded by everything we created and doesent want to think about it at all with ""it's gonna be good"" mindset. 

I don't know. I don't feel like it's OK to just pretend there's nothing to talk about. Also I belive we are old enough that we should at least to some extend know what we want to do with our lives. Or at least old enough to ask certain questions with the intention to get answers. 
AITA for pushing? I really don't know how to handle it all... 

Tl;dr: I don't want kids, my gf of 4y does not want to decide now and not in the nearest future, probably fears breakup so does not say what she truly feels.

relationship_advice,"I love my girlfriend so much. She is the apple of my eye and is one of the very few people I feel like understands me. I do question our relationship from time to time and now regularly that we argue very often. When we come to a disagreement on something she is the first one to raise her voice and get defensive and personal. We could be arguing over something minuscule such as directions to get to a certain place and she makes it very personal and raises her voice and that raises the stress level of the argument for me and makes me go into a fight or flight state. (My own childhood trauma response I and trying to work on 🙂) I feel unsafe and then don’t know what to do but argue my own corner at this point. I try to stay calm and as respectful as possible and commit to communicating my point. She immediately stabs at me as a person when I say my side. She tells me to shut the f up, to go away, to go f myself and to f off. Or when I try to say my side she tells me that I’m wrong and I misunderstood the situation or what I’m saying doesn’t make sense. It feels like she feels bad about her side of the argument so she tries to confuse me and speaks over me so I appologise for even bringing up the issue. She has very bad anxiety and at times I feel I am walking on eggshells and changing my behaviour and spoken words to avoid conflict to try to keep her happy. Along the way I feel like I am losing myself and the string character I know I am. What should I do?

relationship_advice,"So its been about 5 months at least since our relationship started. Ofc in the beginning everything is perfect. My feelings was so strong. They sometimes dont feel the same.. before i badly wanted to hold around her and kiss all the time. Now its kinda like just a thing i feel like I have to do. It goes up and down. Sometimes i really want to. But I have periods where its hard to feel like I actually want to. With sex too. Im worried when I dont feel the urge to want to do those things in a long period of time but I feel like I should. I love her. I know i would be heartbroken if we werent together anymore. I know deep in my soul i want to spend the rest of my life with her. Its just like sometimes the romantic feelings are completely numb. Gode. I just know i care and love her more than anyone else.

I do have chronic depression and I do have had problems witb separation anxiety. Started of as friends and I got very atached. It was and still sometimes is hard to find things to do on my own. I have started working with that tho. So maybe the problem is that I have spent too much time.with her? Tbat i need to take a step back and just try to do other things? I do but it still doesnt feel enough. 

Maybe im also just overthinking alot because I have constant stress",t2_7y3ib6rr,0,"Me (25m), her (30f).

relationship_advice,"to explain the situation: I’ve been talking to this guy, let’s call him John, online for a little while and everything seemed to go well. He doesn’t live very far away from me and we got along great. Now yesterday we’ve played an online game together. 
During the game Ive participated in the open game chat in a little conversation with other people, one of them asking for a recommendation for some movie they could watch later that day, and since they were nice I joined into the conversation.
after a while he told me to „stop talking to the other people in the game and rather talk to him“
now this didn’t sit well with me and I’ve confronted him about it. He told me that he felt lonely and ignored by me since I talked to the other people via the game (text) chat and now I don’t know what to do.
He’s messaged me multiple times over the day now, apologising or telling me that this situation is hurting him and that he misses me.

relationship_advice,"Hi Guys, I’m in a weird situation so hear me out…

I work with this girl and have done for the last year or so. We have always been quite close as friends and she has been quite open with me about life issues and relationship problems etc etc.

Over the past couple of months things have started to change, we had became a lot closer in terms of trust and our relationship started to develop more feelings for each-other than friends should have.

I have known for a while that her boyfriend of 4 years has been controlling and manipulating her, he lives off her for her money, doesn’t allow her to see her friends and routinely would check her devices. She feels trapped in her relationship as he threatens to kill himself if she leaves when she mentions any problems to him regarding their relationship. She has told me she’s been ready to leave for a year.

As a good friend, I have tried to advise her in the most non biased way possible, to which i feel made her develop the feelings she has for me. She now knows what it’s like to feel appreciated by someone and have someone that will try help her with her issues rather than shut them down.

I haven’t proceeded to tell her about my feelings for her and I wouldn’t do anything to invade on their relationship however she has openly told me that she has feelings for me and would like to be able leave him for someone like me…

If she was to do so, would you consider her as someone you could trust in a relationship even though she has feelings for me whilst in a relationship? It’s a hard situation as i’ve read before you shouldn’t trust someone who can catch feelings for someone else whilst in a relationship.

It just seems to me as though she’s only stayed with him because she’s scared of the threats he makes…

We recently discovered that she's even found me on Pinterest.
I've considered blocking her, but my husband said it's pointless because she's always had multiple fake accounts/profiles 🙄 
She hasn't tried contacting either of us, but I find this behavior very odd and almost unsettling... mainly because it's been going on for years. I understand being curious when an ex first starts seeing someone new... but not for years?!!

relationship_advice,"He keeps giving me double signals and I feel like I'm about to implode.

So, I 23f have a close friend 23m that I've known for about six or seven years at this point. We met through a mutual friend and have gotten relatively close after that. About a year ago I confessed that I had a crush on him, and he responded with that he was flattered but needed time to think since he's not the best at handling emotions. I didn't say much but just gave him time and we never came back to that discussion ever again. This to say he knows I have feelings for him and where I stand in that area.

Whenever him and I are hanging out without his closest guy mates around he gives me really mixed signals, like he stands close to me, brushes his arm against mine and seeks a lot of eye contact. He also asks a lot about what's going on in my life and seems legitimately interested in me as a person. But if I text him, or his closest guy mates are around I'm essentially ghosted. It's at times as if I'm not even there and I often have to repeat myself if I wanna say something. This mostly happens on Discord but also IRL. 

I don't know if he's toying with my feelings on purpose or what is going on, but he shows signs of wanting to get close to me when it's just him and I, when it's not, I feel more like an annoyance to him than anything else. What can I do at this point? I feel extremely frustrated not knowing what he wants or is trying to communicate.

relationship_advice,"
To make things easier I’ll call my boyfriend Tom. 

Basically, when I (20F) met Tom (21M) I was seeing somebody else, however, that person had been quite toxic, and I found out he had been seeing other women while being with me and groomed a child before we were together, so I emotionally checked out of my relationship, and only stayed with him because he’d refuse when I tried to end things. 

When I met Tom, I quickly developed a crush on him, he showed me a kindness that I hadn’t really been given by men before. I know it was wrong, but I ended up sleeping with him.  We ended up going on a group trip with our team (I did not know he would be going when I signed up) and I realised how much I actually liked him. We basically spent the whole thing together and talked a lot, agreeing that we both had quite strong feelings for each other, and that I would finally end things with my ex because of this. When I got back home, I saw my family for a few days and immediately after I broke with my ex. After that, I went on a few dates with Tom, and things just went well from there, ever since we’ve been seeing each other and he has asked me to be his girlfriend about 2 months ago. 

However, here is where the problem starts. Tom is very attractive, and I know he’s seen a lot of girls before me. I don’t mind this as since we’ve known each other, he’s been completely smitten with me, like I am with him. But, the other night, while we were out, he told me while drunk that he has in fact slept with 2 girls since we met. This upset me as I felt like we instantly hit it off and we’re obsessed with each other, but I know due to the circumstances (me having a boyfriend when we met) I couldn’t be angry at him about it if it was during that period, instead I was just a little upset as the thought of him with other people upsets me. After sobering up though, he denied this ever happened, and told me it had been a month or two before we met, and promised he was telling the truth. He promised he had not slept with anyone since we met. 

Now, here is where I know I’m in the wrong. After he told me this, I was confused and felt like it could be true… I checked his phone while he was asleep. On his phone, I found that, he in-fact had been talking to / sleeping with other girls up until a week before he asked me to be his girlfriend. And the thing that upset me most - after the trip we went on, he had been talking to me so romantically, but doing the exact same to another girl. In fact, he asked me to go to his home city to meet his parents, and said he would take me to the beach. He also told all this to another girl. She texted him a week after our trip saying ‘I had your cock in my mouth a few days ago so I think I deserve a response’. So he slept with her after we told each other of our feelings I believe. He told me he hadn’t wanted anyone at all since the moment he met me, which is genuinely how I feel about him. Since we met, everyone else is just blurry figures… if that makes sense. I think it’s just made me realise that clearly isn’t the case for him. 

It sort of feels like karma, since I cheated on my ex, but at the same time, it really fucking hurts, because I think for the first time in my life, I could be happy with someone forever. 

He’s also really mad at me for going on his phone and invading his privacy. We’ve said well leave it a few days, but I think I need an outside perspective as I’m very upset at the minute. Basically, im asking if what’s happens is really that bad, and if i should leave him for it, or if im overreacting?",t2_hlpbmyvr,0,Should I dump my (21F) boyfriend (21M) for seeing other women?,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12ws7mr,True,hanawashere,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12ws7mr/should_i_dump_my_21f_boyfriend_21m_for_seeing/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12ws7mr/should_i_dump_my_21f_boyfriend_21m_for_seeing/,8849647,1682287951,0,,False,1682287964,1682287965,2023-04-23 22:12:31,,,

relationship_advice,"My girlfriend cheated on me and it's been going on since we got together (6 months ago) she recently came over to my place and I remembered one of her friends spreading rumors about me. My girlfriend trusts me with her phone she has my fingerprint and we know each other's passwords. I decided to Snoop around to see if I could find her and see what else she has said about me. So I open it up around 2:00 a.m. after not being able to sleep and I find a DM from a different guy. I scroll up to see the older text messages and I see they have been role-playing with each other, sending explicit pictures and flirting a lot. I talked to my closest friend about it and asked him what he thought of him he told me to wake her up and try and talk things out. After waking her up and confronting her she told me how before we got together she was popular on a streaming app that she used to have. She told me how she met this dude about a month before we got together. She didn't want her reputation from the app to get to her and so she continued to flirt with a guy but was distancing herself from him little by little. It hurts because I remember her buying special outfits for me and then finding out that she also sent it to him (kinky maid outfit). She told me how she really regretted it in how bad she felt that she hurt me in this way but at the same time she knew that I was going to find out because I had her phone password. I love her to pieces and I would like to try again and build up that trust we once had but I don't know if I can.

relationship_advice,"
me and my bf  18F 19M  have been dating for 1 year and 9 months. we don’t live together, we both work full time and live in different cities. its an hour drive so he comes over every weekend to hang out. recently i met this guy online who started talking to me. my bf was at his friends house which meant he was busy with him and wasnt online messaging me. this guy was from the uk and he was giving me a lot of attention. my bf and i havent been perfect recently and are trying to work on things, so im not sure if that’s something. 

anyway i ended up sending the guy a couple of nudes and i realised straight after id fucked up so bad. when i sent them my brain wasnt even thinking about my bf and im not sure why since hes always on my mind and i love him to pieces.

i told him the next day and of course he was upset as he has just recovered from having pretty bad mental health problems. he came over on the weekend and apart from when we talked about it, everything was great and we hung out and were so happy and just did everything like we usually did. he decided he wants to take a break for two weeks, not come over and not message, so he can see the permanency of that. im really worried he will want to leave me and ik i deserve that but i dont wanna just throw it away.

id do ANYTHING to take it back or fix things, but i know thats just live and i cant. 

im thinking about going to counselling so i can figure out why this happened, and idk if couples counselling could be an option either. 

any advice would be appreciated, to either me or my bf",t2_jpimeqo4,0,i cheated and idk what to do now 18F 19M,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wrxsz,True,Basic-Ad-7085,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wrxsz/i_cheated_and_idk_what_to_do_now_18f_19m/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wrxsz/i_cheated_and_idk_what_to_do_now_18f_19m/,8849593,1682287413,0,,False,1682287425,1682287426,2023-04-23 22:03:33,,,

relationship_advice,"Hello, Reddit community!
I need some advice on how to handle my new boyfriend's penis. We've been together for two months now, and he is amazing. We never had sex before until now. However, when we finally did, I was shocked to find out that he is uncircumcised. I've only ever been with circumcised guys before, so this is a new experience for me. I tried having sex with him, but I just don't know what to do with his foreskin. Also, when I tried to perform oral sex on him, the smell was repulsive, and I nearly threw up. I've always had a personal preference for circumcised penises, and I find it challenging to deal with. I want to know if there are any ladies out there who had a similar experience and how they dealt with it. I feel like I might be wrong for wanting him to get circumcised, but I can't help my preferences. I don't want to offend him or hurt his feelings, but at the same time, I want to enjoy our sexual experiences. So, what should I do? Should I talk to him about it or is it better to leave him? How should I bring the topic of circumcision?

relationship_advice,"So for context we are currently staying with his family temporarily and I moved from my home state to be with him a few states away in his home state. So currently I'm using one of the chargers, and the other charger is in the room with me. I hear him complaining to his mom outside the door saying that I always take all his chargers (even though some of the chargers are mine too that I bought) and now he can't charge his phone, and he keeps just speaking in a very rude way about it to his mom. I come out and bring him a charger and say ""you could've just came and asked me for one, it's not that big of a deal"" and he replies ""you always make it seem like a big deal"" which first of all, I have no idea what he's talking about. He's the one whose making an issue out of nothing, it takes zero effort to come ask if I have a charger he can use rather than go to his mom and complain about something that isn't even an issue. 

I'm just sick of his attitude. 

He makes issues out of NOTHING. Its so draining for me. He also just complains so much about things sucking and life sucking, when he has so much to be grateful for. His mom is very supportive and always helps him out no matter what he needs, he has a supportive family, meanwhile my mom can't support me and hasn't ever been able to because she can't even support herself. She is currently struggling with homelessness and recovering from addiction. Aside from that my family is very small, and the ones I do have don't talk to eachother and just keep to themselves. With that being said, I STILL don't complain and am not as negative about life as he is. I am grateful for what I have, grateful to have met my partner because I love him, and grateful for the roof over my head, grateful for my job and coworkers, and grateful to be alive. 

Listening to him be so negative about life is so exhausting.

Here's another example of his unnecessary behavior, a month ago we were hungry and broke so his mom gave him some money so that we can get jack in the box. We went and at the drive thru after we ordered I asked for some sauce, he started getting all huffy puffy and saying ""oh my god, don't do that, I already have my foot on the pedal"" but i literally asked as we were still stopped..He just started freaking out over it saying he was ""overstimulated"" like I get overstimulation, but just don't get how someone can get so overstimulated over something as simple as ordering from a drive thru to the point where they make their partner visibly uncomfortable. Anyway, his behavior made me really anxious so even as we went through the windows and got our food I didn't bother to ask for sauce, because I felt like he would get upset again.

relationship_advice,"So last night, my ex girlfriend called me after not speaking for about 7 months (she was partying with friends and I knew because she accidentally left a quick voicemail). I let it ring and told my current girlfriend that she called.

My girlfriend was pretty cool about it and recommended I don’t even respond because it'll just give her attention.

The issue is, I know my ex pretty well and although she has not followed up with a text yet, I know that she will. Or she will be calling again. Basically, it was a booty call that I don't want to reoccur because of my new relationship.

Personally, I'd like to text her and just let her know I am dating somebody else so that she stops. If I do so, should I tell my gf that I texted her this or do I not bring it up again and just let it be after that? Or do I listen to my gf’s advice, although I’d prefer to speak up?

relationship_advice,"We don't live together yet, though we have discussed it many times. My question is what to do about differences in quality time needs. Quality time is my love language, and I want to have at least one day a week with my person. My partner is very different though-- he is profoundly introverted, sensitive, and a ""lone wolf"" type. And when he feels tired or moody (usually after his weekend with his two kids), he often won't reach out or respond to texts at all for a few days. We've discussed this ad nauseam and I just think we need different things. I'm a plant that likes tropical rainfall a few times per week, and he's a succulent that could easily go weeks without seeing me. Then when we do finally meet up, he fills up his love tank and he's good for a long time. I'm just wondering if any of you out there have made a situation like this work for you. He and I have a really good relationship in so many ways except for this one, but I don't feel like we're really compromising on this one. He just takes space no matter how it affects me.

relationship_advice,"TLDR: Fiance has a new friend who has feelings for her and she still hangs out with him despite it bothering me, I now feel like a 3rd wheel every time we all hang out together and I dont know if my feelings are valid or if I would be controlling to say this really bothers me.

\---

Hey guys, ive never made a post like this before, but I wanted to try as to not only get some advice on if my feelings are valid but also act as a kind of therapeutic outlet as I dont have anyone else I can talk about this with.

Me and my fiance have been together for a little over 6 years now and everything has been pretty alright so far. Fortunately and unfortunately I got into my dream grad school recently for my dream job. This is great and all but its in a state 1,600 miles from home and I am away from home every 3 months with only a week long break in between each semester. Whilst this sucks the program is only 2 years long so its not forever. This hasnt been a huge strain on my relationship from what I can tell as both of us are avid gamers and thus I am able to find the time to game with her every night unless I have an exam the next day. Its been seemingly harder on me than her in fact as a couple of her past relationships had periods of long distance. Plus, she visited me a couple times during my first semester which was nice.

Anyway, now that the slight back story is out of the way I can get to the issue at hand. I just finished my first week long break after my first semester and I am back in the grad school state. Towards the end of my first semester a new guy started hanging out with us while we gamed, hes a friend of our other friend. At first, he would play with us for like an hour and bounce but slowly he started hanging out with us more. I never had an issue with this as I thought the guy was funny and fun to be around and my fiance agreed. This slowly progressed into him private messaging my fiance and them playing together alone. Once again, I had no issue and was happy that she had someone to game with on the nights I couldnt when I was busy. The issues began when I got home however a week ago. She brought up that she thinks this guy liked her and asked what I thought. When she mentioned it I said I could see that being the case just by how he acted around her. I never really cared though since this guy was married and in another state as well stuck with a military contract job thats keeping him there for another few years. Plus, I went to high school with this guy and while I wasnt best friends with him we were still friends so like even if he did like her I didnt think he'd do me like that.

Fast forward to the first day im back home after not seeing her for a month and a half and she had the idea of ""jokingly"" hitting on him to confirm her suspicions. Mind you I was a bit uncomfortable with this, but she assured me she isnt attracted to him in any way and its all a joke and if I want her to stop she will. I begrudgingly went along with it (a mistake on my part I admit) and whilst she was doing it she showed me every message between them on Discord. Surprise surprise he ended up liking her and hitting on her back and eventually admitting how unhappy he is in his marriage and how his wife cheated on him and doesnt want kids while he does, etc etc. I started getting sussed out when over the next couple days she stopped showing me the messages between the two of them and got defensive and angry when I asked about it. I got a bit peeved since this guy clearly likes her and then she got mad at me and pretty much said ""ive told you what hes saying when you ask, you dont need to read it, or what hes saying isnt interesting so why do you even want to read it, etc."" Then she told me ""but clearly you dont trust me so I just wont be friends with him anymore and we will have to drop our friend group to accommodate me."" Long story short we had a minor argument resulting in me caving and essentially just dropping it as she made me feel like I was being controlling and untrusting of her and maybe I was, I dont know. I have no issue with her having privacy between friends, it just sussed me out when it went from unrequested willingness to share to nothing at all and getting mad when I brought it up.

As this past week has progressed they are hanging out more and more and I saw she moved to talking to him on snapchat. When we were gaming while I was home we'd all be gaming together and I'd see them messaging each other on snapchat the entire time we were all in a call together. The guy has started acting slightly hostile towards me and I almost feel like a 3rd wheel when we are all playing together. I say this because half the stuff I say goes ignored, none of them laugh at my jokes anymore, but every single thing he says gets a response from her. In addition, hes begun the divorce process with his wife this past week and wants to plan a visit back home (hes originally from the area we all are)... She told me she will probably hang out with him when he comes home but she doesnt want to see me getting all controlling about it as they are just friends and I need to trust her.

I feel like im going insane, the one time I brought it up that this whole thing is bothering me she started telling me I was being controlling and didnt trust her and threatened to essentially nuke our entire friend group. This is because it would, in her words, be awkward to keep playing with him but since hes friends with our other gaming friends we wouldnt be able to play with any of them anymore as she put it. I dont know what to do as its really bothering me but the last thing I want to do is be controlling. I cant control who she hangs out with and I cant stop her from cheating if she wanted to but even though I understand that im feeling really insecure and paranoid.

I need advice as I cant talk about this with anyone else since all my other friends are also friends with either this guy or my fiance. I love her with all my heart and I dont want to ruin our relationship if im just being insecure, but if I need to grow a backbone please tell me the best way to approach this as I dont want to destroy my friend group in the process.",t2_gt5y3w5f,0,My (24m) Fiance (25f) has a new guy friend and I need advice,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wrjo0,True,LickMyWorm,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wrjo0/my_24m_fiance_25f_has_a_new_guy_friend_and_i_need/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wrjo0/my_24m_fiance_25f_has_a_new_guy_friend_and_i_need/,8849503,1682286645,0,,False,1682286660,1682286660,2023-04-23 21:50:45,,,

relationship_advice,"I've been with her for about 5 years. We loved each other so much, but we broke up two weeks ago because of severe incompatibility issues, both of us tried to make things work, but it failed. We always got into arguments because of our differences.

Before the breakup we had a terrible argument and we didn't speak to each other for a week. I was upset because her colleague was flirting with her on WhatsApp and she kept replying back. She told she was pissed that he was flirting with her but she kept replying him back ignoring his flirtations. That guy even called her darling.

She informed me this via text. Although I was glad that she informed me, but I was upset that she was continuing the conversation with him. I told her I needed to talk to her about this, but she replied by saying there's no point in having serious conversations about this, and that it's not even important to her.

When she got back, we spoke on the phone, which led to the terrible argument I mentioned earlier and we didn't speak for a week. A week later I get a call from her, we get into an argument again and she tells me she's getting engaged, to her colleague, not the guy that called her darling but a different more senior one.

She said she called me because she wants to make things better with me before she gets engaged with him and that's why she called. I thought she called because she wanted to fix things.

I've been with her for 5 years. Met her in uni. She was the love of my life. She has told me over and over again for the past 5 years that no one has made her feel the way I made her feel and she can't feel this way with anyone else. She has been there for me during difficult periods of my life, we went through thick and thin together. I've even met her entire family and I got along well with all of them.

I genuinely believed she was the one I will marry. She was my best friend in the truest sense of the word. But now she's getting engaged to a colleague she just met 2 months ago. She told me he's told her everything and he's got health issues but she's ready to face everything with him.

She invited me to her engagement and she wanted me to come because according to her no one from her family will be attending. I felt hurt that she was even inviting me, as if she doesn't know it'll hurt me to see her getting engaged to someone else. But at the same time, I felt terribly bad because she said no one else would be there and she would like me to be there for her and I've been thinking for the past week whether I should go or not, this one last time. Maybe it'll help me move on faster, I don't know. 

I'm typing all this here because I can't focus on my work, I can't stop thinking about this, few hours ago I couldn't hold back my tears. 

No one in my family or friends circle knows about this. I feel like I can't talk about this to anyone. I can't even think straight.

I don't know what to do or feel, or even if my feelings are valid, I can't even trust myself and I don't know if I can trust anyone else anymore.",t2_8kdvc0pv,0,"Ex (24 F) is getting engaged, I (26 M) can't stop thinking about it",[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wrgya,True,Main_Battle_7300,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wrgya/ex_24_f_is_getting_engaged_i_26_m_cant_stop/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wrgya/ex_24_f_is_getting_engaged_i_26_m_cant_stop/,8849481,1682286494,0,,False,1682286504,1682286505,2023-04-23 21:48:14,,,

relationship_advice,"My wife (33F) and I (38M) have been married for over 5 years and have been having relationship problems which started with the birth of our second child (we have two kids, ages 5 and 2). Life is very stressful right now for both of us with the challenges of 2 young kids. 

My wife is the default parent and has been closed off and unavailable because she says she gives everything to the kids and has nothing else left. There hasn't been much intimacy or romantic connection for over a year. I play an active role as a parent but we both acknowledge that things are tough right now. We've been going to therapy for almost a year trying to work on things, but she's still pretty closed off most of the time and says this difficulty is temporary and will pass as the kids get older.

My wife and I were watching a game on TV last night and I asked if they were playing at a stadium that had been torn down years ago. She immediately asked me ""are you fucking stupid?""

relationship_advice,"Hi, please don’t share this anywhere, I do not give my permission. 

I (37F) recently moved with my bf (41m) to a new town, so I have been getting busy making new friends. 

One woman (42F) seemed extremely cool when I first met her 2 months ago - witty, wry, funny. My bf and I hosted her and her bf once for dinner and we all  had a great time, I was SO happy to have made such a funny and lovely-seeming new friend.

But then, starting 2 days after that first hangout, she started texting me about all the awful fights she has with her bf. Sending screenshots of the terrible, TERRIBLE things he text-rants at her about. Talking about how he yells at her, is horrible to her kids, sometimes pushes her or yanks her around by one arm, etc. 

It became immediately clear that she’s in an emotionally, and increasingly physically, abusive relationship - I don’t know if he’s hit her yet, but she’s said he’s done things like, knocking her hat off her head when angry; pushing her; yanking her by her arm towards the door when he wanted to leave an event and she didn’t yet; stuff like that. So if he hasn’t hit her yet, I feel like it’s it’s pretty clearly heading in that direction. It’s horrible.

I should mention that I have a fair amount of experience with abusive relationships myself - I was in 2 long-term abusive relationships, one after the other, when I was late teens through to mid twenties. So, I know what it’s like. The terror. The SHAME. The loneliness. You’re so embarrassed for staying and yet you just can’t bring yourself to leave because you’ve got no money, no resources, nowhere to go, he’s told you he’ll burn all your things/take your dog and never give her back if you try to leave, and you’ve got no friends left cuz he’s driven them all away. You can’t talk honestly to anyone you know about your situation, because they won’t understand why on earth you don’t just leave, and will just say things like “you should leave him” and “he’s a terrible person why are you still with him”, “leave or he’ll kill you”, etc, and then you end up being too ashamed to see your own friends any more because you KNOW you should leave and you can’t explain even to yourself why you haven’t yet. It’s horrible and lonely and so, so isolating. So I get what she’s going through. (I recently found out about trauma-bonding, and it explains A LOT about my own history and certain things about my attachment style as an adult.)

So here’s where I’m running into trouble: this brand new, budding friendship has  *instantly* become 100% one-sided. Since the very first time she texted me about his abusive behavior, she has completely stopped ever asking me a *single question* about myself (or about anything at all). Everything is now 100% about her and her life. 

When she texts me (which is reasonably often), it’s like news bulletins, rather than a text from a new friend. No hello/how are you/anything like that, just announcements: “well we had another huge fight last night, I feel terrible now” or “so I told him I was feeling overwhelmed and his response was to tell me to stop being such a narcissist”, stuff like that.  

I feel truly terrible for this woman, and would like to help as much as I (healthily) can. But I’m getting overwhelmed here. First of all, this feels like A LOT for a friendship so young, for someone to already become completely self-absorbed with their own (admittedly terrible) problems. I would like to be friends with this person (I … think?? Not so sure now honestly), but I do not want to be her therapist and I am slowly getting more and more resentful that she only ever talks about herself. I do not want any more one-sided friendships in my life, I’ve had a lot of those. Plus, I’m actually going through a lot myself these days (recently diagnosed with a debilitating chronic illness, chronic pain/fatigue now, had to stop work, I lost my business, can’t leave the house much any more, etc etc) and I just don’t have the mental or emotional wherewithal to be someone’s therapist. I would do everything to help an existing friend in this situation … but … i feel bad for saying this but the truth is that I don’t even KNOW this woman. 

I’ve been taken advantage of a lot by people I trusted in the past (I think I’m too trusting or something, I used to feel like I had the word “sucker” tattooed on my forehead) and I’m worried that I might be doing the same thing again here with this woman: giving my all to someone who doesn’t give much of a shit about me. (I have done a LOT of therapy and hard work on myself to move past this.)

It would be different if she was taking even a tiny interest in me too - like, at ALL, even a token “how was your day?” would go a long way at this point - but she’s not. I know she’s in a crisis situation, so of course she’ll want/need to focus large amounts of time and energy on that situation (and rightly so); and, I am more than happy to devote a mountain of time and energy to helping a friend in a bad situation. But I don’t know if what she and I have could even be called a friendship yet. I don’t want to turn my back on someone in need, and she CLEARLY needs someone to talk to. But, I also don’t want to throw myself on the pyre of *yet another* one-way friendship. And it doesn’t help that I’d only JUST met her when she pulled back the curtain on her true situation, it’s not like we have years or even months of accumulated trust and goodwill to call upon - I don’t even know her yet, I don’t even really know if she’s a good person or not. I used to just trust my gut about people but I don’t do that any more cuz that’s a big part of why I always got sucked into bad friendships/relationships in the past.

(Plus, she showed me a text her bf sent her that was all about her being a narcissist and “always making the entire conversation about herself”. And now … it keeps bouncing around in my mind. Yeah he sounds abusive af, that is NOT a healthy relationship, but also … what if he’s right? I do not want another narcissistic friend. I have worked long and hard on myself and people who never ask questions is a hard limit for me these days.) 

So the question is: Should I say something?? “Hey new friend, I know you’re in hell, but when are we going to talk about me me meeeee?” Argh.
Everything I can think of seems selfish and horrible and I truly don’t know the best way to handle this.

relationship_advice,"So she broke up with me 2 weeks ago, the argument was messy, things were said that simply cannot be taken back, it was really a rough break up, she packed her bags and left. the following night she text me that she still loved me and she was sorry. 2 days after, we were meeting to take our daughter to a doctors appointment were she told me she no longer has any love for me, shes happy the relationship is over, the last two days at my place was hell and that shes really happy living with her auntie. 

On Wednesday she decided and i agreed that we would only keep in contact about our daughter and reassured me that we would never get back together after i confessed my love for her. hours later after deciding this, she sent me a tik tok video that reminded me off her which she said ""i had to send you this"", i didnt reply, she replied to a snapchat story that was unrelated to our daughter also. thursday - saturday, she asked how was our girl doing (as she is staying with me from thursday until monday) id simply respond that she was doing great and that was it, same on friday and on saturday. 

Today, she asked me how our daughter was doing and after i responded she immediately video called me which i declined, she then asked could she, which i just agreed to. as soon as i answered she smiled but immediately started crying, she said its because she misses our girl so much, but i knew something else was up and she just wouldnt tell me, as conversation went on, she would talk about other things, how her day was going and asked me about my haircut and interests in hobbies that we both shared, i didnt bother stopping her even though it was her decision to solely keep  it baby related. i was just confused.. she then told me that her aunties house didnt feel like home and that she was up lastnight and couldnt get much sleep. she then also mentioned that she hates that our daughter has to travel up and down to be with me and then her even though its just shy of a 15 minute drive.  i reassured her that im here for her, whatever she needs, i can help out and i told her not to be stubborn and that shes not always right and if she truly wants to reach out to me about certain things she can. 

im really unsure what she wants, she confuses me so much, im here for her and she knows it, but its as if she doesnt want to admit that she feels lonely without me, yes she may miss our daughter but its clear she doesnt want to be living with her auntie anymore either. id take her back to my place if she asked, id support her, i know after pregnancy is a tough time, im not looking for a relationship with her, i just want to support her and the best interest for our little girl.",t2_9kw41ydz4,0,"I (M23) am beyond confused with my now ex girlfriend (F22), we have a 7 week old daughter together.",[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,2,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wrfan,True,ThrowRA_rambloblood,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wrfan/i_m23_am_beyond_confused_with_my_now_ex/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wrfan/i_m23_am_beyond_confused_with_my_now_ex/,8849469,1682286402,0,,False,1682286418,1682286419,2023-04-23 21:46:42,,,

relationship_advice,"I dated my husband for 6 months before we got together. As a backstory, the reason we got married in the first place was because he went out with his friend and 2 girls without telling me. That same day I went to the mall with a friend to pass time. He found out I was at the mall and immediately left to wingstop. He called me while he was at at the restaurants bathroom yelling at me and saying that I was cheating on him. (Side note: I was not obv). After this I tried to break up with him when I found out and he threw a whole fit inside my truck and would refuse to get off. So I got off to distract him before I ran back to my truck and instead of talking or whatever he started crying and asked me to marry him. He never visited me when we were dating. He doesn’t like having sex with me and will avoid it at all costs but when it happens he is completely different while in the act. Afterwards there is little to no aftercare. He never initiates sex and I think it’s weird because he told me he had a porn addiction when he was 10 and that at the peak he would J.O. At least 5x a day. The problem is I only think I’m valuable by hyper sexual using myself because I was abused as a child. The fact that we hardly ever have sex makes it so emotionally painful to me. We probably only have sex 3x a month. He never eats me out. I began to think it was a hygiene problem with me simply because I could not understand why he wouldn’t do that. When we were dating he would do it all the time but it always felt very forced? Like he didn’t want to but was doing it out of compromise. He doesn’t buy me flowers or take me on dates. He acts like he doesn’t care if I leave him. He gets mad if I tell him something upsets me and says I’m always nagging. 4 months ago we had a really bad argument because I simply told him I didn’t think it was right for him to let his friend talk about my car that my dad worked so hard to buy me as if it was his. He didn’t like that ig and made it an even bigger argument and he packed his shit and left so I left too. He came back and the argument got bigger and I ended up throwing flour and eggs at him which I’m not proud of. He broke the door of the restroom where I was trying to avoid him because I have adhd and felt extremely overwhelmed and oversensatized. He apologized and we had makeup sex (which I didn’t want to have but didn’t say anything). The next day he acted like I didn’t exist. He didn’t look at me or talk to me. I went to the store and got eggs and wrote him a note (which I left at the door) apologizing. I texted him a long paragraph explaining how I felt so alone and I was just gonna stop bothering him (because I was gonna go read a book at a parking lot to pass time). He took offense to this and before I knew it there was 4 state troopers behind my car. They had called an ambulance and were sending me to rehab for a “suicide attempt”. The reason they took it so seriously was because I had had a suicide attempt before when I was 16. I was having a shitty time at home and my grandma who raised me died a couple days after my birthday so I took some pills and what not. So they took me to the local hospital ER where they did some blood tests, and I was just sitting there waiting . Eventually, I love her and I decided that I didn’t want to be there but since I left my car in the parking lot I couldn’t leave so I had to text him to come pick me up . He kept refusing to answer that this was the best for me and whatever . I literally had to take him for 30 minutes to come pick me up because he was still stuck on the ideas for seeing me involuntarily into a mental hospital. So he picks me up and I get in the car and I started telling him asking him why he would do something like that and that it wasn’t right. And he started yelling at me so I yelled back and he acted like he was doing a huge favor by picking me up at the hospital because I told him that I had to run out since they didn’t want to let me go. I had to walk out of the hospital because they were trying to put a straight jacket on me because they genuinely thought that I was incapacitated. Not to mention this is a horrible hospital, which has 2.5 star reviews. He started getting so upset about the fact that I had left them that they were gonna call the cops on me or whatever but I’m a law students so I had a way around it and it all worked out at the end. 
He never actually apologized for this . He still blames me and always brings up the egg thing refusing to acknowledge everything he did that led up to it. In fact he thinks I was entirely at fault during the whole situation. I have cried to him asking him to care like a husband should. I think the way he is is so unattractive. I don’t like who he is. I hate his music taste, it’s hideous. I hate the way he thinks and the way he speaks. I hate the way he acts. Everything he does gives me the ick.

relationship_advice,"Thank you for reading my post! 

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a year, and he is the first relationship I have EVER been in. I think that’s contributing to this problem, but I don’t know because I’ve never had this experience before. Of course, I’d hooked up with people in college, but I was always “too fat” to date, so it’s really strange to experience these things for the first time. 

When we first got together, my boyfriend always did things to show that he cared about me. He’d buy me flowers, do things with me that I wanted to do, watch stuff that I wanted to watch…all these things that made me feel cared for and appreciated. But now, it’s almost like he only likes me for the companionship and care he gets from me, but he doesn’t actually care about me as a person. 

I do want to include that my boyfriend has multiple chronic illnesses and autoimmune conditions, which does prohibit many things I’d always dreamt of in relationships. I’ve made peace with that and have found ways around it. Sometimes, though, I feel as if he uses it as an excuse to keep from doing things with me, at least doing things I want to do. 

Since it has started feeling this way, I’ve pulled away. I’ve stopped talking on the phone and texting as much, and when we do talk on the phone I’ve avoided talking (other than “yeahs” and other sounds of acknowledgement of his statements) unless he explicitly asks a question. Last week, I’d been on the phone for 30 minutes before he even once brought up the topic of me, and as soon as I said “well, you know, I’m decently tired but” he interrupted me and said “well, now you know how I feel all of the time” (relating to his illnesses). I got really frustrated, and our conversations have gone just like that ever since. 

He also never wants to do anything. We’ve been on one date, ever (our first one), and every time we are together he says he doesn’t have energy to do anything but sit at home. But, he will hang out with friends, travelled to visit friends where they did tons of different things, and go out and about anytime I’m not there. 

Here is the tipping point, and I’m uncertain as to whether I am being over dramatic with this. We get ice cream together every Saturday. I don’t eat around him and we don’t eat meals together, so I just eat ice cream for dinner on the Saturdays that I am with him. Yesterday, I competed in this huge cross fit competition that I begged him to go to in support. It was about a 2 hour drive away, so I agreed that it was okay for him not to go. Unexpectedly, I got 2nd place, and was so excited to reward myself with our Saturday ice cream. We’d how excited I was for it 4 times before I made it to his house. We hung out for a while, and when I said “when we go get ice cream, we can…” he said “well, I don’t really feel like going to get ice cream tonight, so maybe we can do something to celebrate next weekend or something.” After this, and the fact that when I told him that I’d placed all he did was ask if I could do his laundry when I got back, I just couldn’t take it. I spent the rest of the night crying while he watched stupid political videos on YouTube. 

Does it seem like he’s just into the relationship because of what he can get from it? I don’t know what to do, because there are times when we do have fun together, but lately it just feels like I am completely alone in my relationship. 

TLDR: My boyfriend doesn’t seem to care about me anymore, and only does things with me if they peak his interested, and I’m not sure what I should do.

relationship_advice,"Hi. Not sure if this is person-specific or a problem of mine in general. But I assume the the latter.

I'm basically dating the same person now for over a year. We're still not in a ""relationship"", or at least we don't call it that. We're exclusive but we never ""commited"" to being officially in a relationship and our proxmity/distance ratio (?) is fluctuating a lot. To make it short: It's kind of a mess. 

I noticed right away that I'm not able to commit ""at the moment"" and told her so. She came from a relationship where she was very dependent of her partner. They did everything together - he didn't ""allow"" him to go partying etc. So she was okay with us going slow because she wanted to become more independent. 

And I noticed that I was scared of committing so it was a ""good fit"" (lol).

We had quite a few good times in the year. I showed her my world a bit and she's not involved in a lot of stuff that I do - like my political involvement (activism etc). She also basically knows .. almost anyone I know now. Even the people outside of this left bubble I am in.

Well and now that I thought about commiting I once again feel like my old pattern now rise up. I get scared, I feel constricted even though she doesn't constrict me in any way. The classic ""fear of commitment"" pattern. 

Because of those feelings I actually decided to end our being-together 2 weeks ago. And then my fear of loss kicked in, nice. I felt very alone and on the same time I noticed that she's now literally everywhere. I don't want to call them that but these were all ""my friends"" that I introduced her to and she is now .. just .. I mean in the art group, the leftist activists, the sport group .. everywhere. It's so overwhelming. Which was also a reason for me to go back to her 2 days ago. Besides the fact that I missed her of course.

But now I'm unsure again. I don't want this to become a stupid on-off thing.

So what can I do? I feel like I'm not able to commit for some reason and when we're not together it stresses me out, that she's just everywhere. I'm especially unsure if I could handle this if she meets someone new and she's still everywhere.

We really have the best time together, share a lot of things and never get bored. I don't think there is any problem with our relationship.

relationship_advice,"I'll try to keep this short but give all the important info. 

I've been with my current gf for 5 years, and I love her more than anything. She took my virginity, has been my only real gf in my entire life, and the only person I've ever sexually been with. 

At this point in time it would be very easy for us to get married, our personalities are a 10000% match and she is the closest person in my life by a landslide. She is a true best friend and partner, and no one  knows more about me than her, and vice versa. 

The problem is that she is the only person I've been with, and I feel like I can't fully commit to her and get married unless I have experience putting myself out there. I have no reference or experience, and I don't want to be one of those people that marry their hs/college sweetheart to find themselves miserable midway into married life with major regret. 

My gf on the other hand loves me a lot and is ready to get married, she is older than me and has had a ton of sexual partners and several serious relationships before me. She knows I am what she wants as  a life partner and there are no doubts in her head at all. 

So my dilemma is should I stay with her risking potential resentment and regret in the future, or should we take a break and risk losing her forever. I really really really do not want to lose her but I'm finding it hard to commit to getting married without knowing the shade of any other grass. 

Other things to consider is that although our personalities are a perfect match and she is the closest person in my life, our relationship isn't perfect. For starters our sex life is a lot less than what I would ideally want/ what you would expect out of two people in their 20s who live alone. There have been times where we would have sex maybe once a month for a decently long period of time. After talking about it the frequency has increased but rn it's maybe like once a week or once every 10 days on average. I have a high libido and could have sex everyday with no problem so that is a little quirk in our relationship.

Another thing is that she is roughly 60 pounds heavier than when we started dating, and as someone who is barely 5 feet, the 60 pounds are significant. I still love her a lot despite the weight gain, but I would be lying if I said that it didn't change my physical attraction to her, especially with the potential of future weight gain and it's looking like the weight is here to stay. 

So that is my dilemma, I don't want to throw away an amazing thing that I have, but part of me feels like I need to go out there and experience a single lifestyle as someone who is in his young to mid 20s, so I know whats out there and I am fully secure in settling down in the future.

relationship_advice,"isolated after a break up

I'm not sure what to do anymore. My partner (22) broke up with me (24m) last Thursday. We dated for a year and a half. I was madly in love and we had almost no issues. We never had a fight and communicated about everything up until the end. Long distance and a few other complicated factors killed the relationship.
I really really thought we would be together forever. I am blindsided. All my plans, the future I had envisioned, is just gone now.
I have no support system. I don’t have friends close by, I don’t have family that would be willing to listen, and I barely see anyone outside of school and work.
I'm a full-time student, and I work full time. I don't have hobbies outside of those things besides pot and books. Outside of work and school, I have almost no interactions with anyone. 
Since the break up, i don’t want to do anything anymore. I've told no one about it and have been trying to keep myself busy. I can't seem to do an activity for more than 20 min without losing all motivation.

So anyway I left, and I told him I needed some space and that he would need to earn back my trust, get himself out of debt etc. and I’m short, we are now at the point where we can’t communicate without arguing. 
We’ve tried marriage counseling but he didn’t like it because he felt the Counsellor was attacking him (he gets super defensive anytime someone tries to hold him accountable). 
He says all these amazing things like he will make it up to me, he wants us to be best friends again etc but then doesn’t actually do anything to make things better? It’s just words.
And when I try to ask him about things, how he’s getting on with his debt etc, he just gets angry and defensive. 
We hadn’t spoken for a week, until this morning, we literally lasted 3 minutes on a call which resulted in him telling me to “shut the f up” and us threatening divorce to eachother.

When I asked why he said she was the love of his life he said he was explaining it from “a story telling perspective “ and I’m the love of his life. I asked why he felt the need to describe everything that way and he told me I was letting my insecurities win and ruined his day. He told me I upset him and was ruining his day by asking questions. But proceeded to say she was the love of his life for a second time and be upset at me when I pointed it out and asked why. He told me I don’t understand how much he loves me and that I’m with him and it’s fine. And I believe he loves me but what he said really confused me.

10 year relationship, I (41) still love them (50) but I am not *in love* and haven’t been for years. They have done nothing wrong. They love me and are not expecting this (despite some warning signs). 

I just can’t find a way to do this and it’s so fucking unfair to both of us. I have told many people that I am doing this today, as a way of having some accountability, but I still just cannot fathom actually having this conversation. They are literally making us dinner 10 feet from me right now. 

We are drunks so I bought a jar of shine to ease the pain. Someone tell me how to fucking do this because it actually seems impossible right now. 

Fun extras: I am taking a lot of the furniture, I have two cats from prior that they love and I am taking away, they have a history of depression and suicidal thoughts. They are past middle aged so this is like.. the end of something they thought would last forever. I hate myself right now but I can’t be in this relationship for the rest of my life.",t2_yxai9y,0,Cannot get the balls to end relationship even though I’m moving out in a few days (40f and 49m),[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wpy1m,True,Cayslayy,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wpy1m/cannot_get_the_balls_to_end_relationship_even/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wpy1m/cannot_get_the_balls_to_end_relationship_even/,8849201,1682283534,0,,False,1682283552,1682283553,2023-04-23 20:58:54,,,

relationship_advice,"okay so basically we started seeing each other 2 months ago and things were PERFECT, we saw each other all the time, we were exclusive and planning to have a relationship soon but about a month ago we one of his friends (who didn’t like me) started saying things to convince him to end it with me, he believed it because there were a lot of people saying the same thing (which wasn’t true!!!!) i came to the conclusion he felt pressured and didn’t know what to do.
so he ended up just cutting me off (but still follows all my other socials) and I just left it but I rly miss him and idk if I should reach out.
Should I reach out and say something? I rly miss him but idk how he feels about me anymore.
He told me he loved me and rly showed it and put in effort.

relationship_advice,"Met on a dating app. I’m always upfront about not wanting kids. The woman I’ve been dating has said won’t have kids and it hasn’t happened yet. It’s a different answer than “I don’t want kids” but the implication is there. So last night we get back to her place and had some beers. We start messing around (she’s on top) and well it went from grinding to penetration. I do wanna say her sex drive is extremely high. To the point that regular touches tend to turn her on. I take it as a good thing as my sex drive is high too and we just click. The sex has been fantastic…..But last night it was unprotected and she isn’t on any birth control. I did end up pulling out before I finished. Afterwards I said that we have to keep using condoms going forward. She said she hates condoms. I said well I can’t take that risk. That’s when she said if she were to get pregnant then it would just happen: “if it happens it happens”. She then begins to talk about not being able to get rid of it (she couldn’t bring herself to get an abortion)and she’d probably keep it. It was a strange thing to say. Then she started talking about how people only have kids because they need someone to take care of them when they’re old. I tell her that isn’t the reason most people have kids. She was adamant on her point to degree that it seemed like there was no room for any other belief. So I told her I do not want kids and never will. She then Started saying stuff like “im not saying I want kids, it’s too late for me to”. She was Kind of backpedaling a bit

One thing led to another and we got on the subject of her life. Her dad committed suicide at 5 and her mom recently died. She says that “everyone in my life dies”. It’s clear that she has unresolved trauma and she has never been to therapy. She thinks that someone else shouldn’t tell her how live and get over these things. I told her that’s not what therapy is and she really wouldn’t budge on her belief. It basically ended in her saying that she can push all of it down and ignore it. 

So today we texted a bit and she said  “All I can say is that for the vast majority of the time I am against having kids. I think it’s only natural to play the what if game. “

So I’m trying to get advice. Because last night really made me worry that she is just trying to get pregnant. And that maybe her hyper sex drive is related to that need? Idk. I feel for the things she’s been through and I hope she can open up to therapy one day because she needs to overcome her trauma, but it’s her decision. I’m wondering if I should just call it off completely at this point or if I’m maybe thinking too far into it",t2_eb8ny15u,0,I 33m have been dating a woman 36f who eluded to not wanting kids for 2 months.

relationship_advice,"Please don't judge me for this, I know it doesn't look great on paper but I act with the best intentions and I am confused and hurt and have no idea what to do.

I've been with my boyfriend since I was 18. I'm now 23 and haven't felt happy in my relationship for a while - I've tried to raise this with my partner but he is not very responsive to this and we live together so I haven't acted on it. He is an amazing guy and I really want to love him as I'll never find a better partner but something is stopping me keeping sexual attraction to him and I'm feeling that my desires are changing. It's tragic to me as I don't know what changed along the way to make me lose feelings and I wish I hadn't. Something traumatic happened to me a couple of years ago so it could be related to that but I'm not sure. 

I started a new job last year and met a coworker who I was attracted to immediately but thought nothing of it as I've had crushes before. He's also engaged - one of the first conversations we had was me drunkenly asking why he was getting married so young (it's very young for Europe), and he responded that their families are religious and encouraging him to. At the time, all I felt was normal attraction so thought 'poor guy' and moved on. 

When we met I wasn't sure what he thought of me but we got along extremely well and I had a great laugh with him. Fast forward a couple months, I flippantly mention my parents can't come to my university graduation and he offers to come. I thought he was kidding but he turned up the next day and sat through my ceremony as my guest. Again, I thought he was just being really kind until he mentioned it in a flirtatious context a while after. 

This has so far happened over the span of 8 months. I've had feelings for him that I've tried to suppress for some time but to no avail. I felt it went beyond a crush and to having deeper feelings for him.

Last week, we were drinking and he admitted having feelings for me and that he knew I had feelings for him too. We held hands for a most of the night, hugged and flirted but agreed nothing could happen (almost kissed a couple of times but avoided it). Another coworker saw this. He disappeared at the end of the night and said 'it was just easier' when I asked why he had left. We've seen each other since and are able to act professional (except for very intense glances and we kept nervously laughing in the first conversation we had after) but I'm finding it really strange to deal with. 

I thought it would make me feel better knowing he reciprocates, and that I could move on with my own life. On the contrary, I have had an awful week, crying daily and not being able to think about much else as I've realised the futility of having feelings for him despite his impending marriage. I know he shouldn't be getting married as it's not fair on him or his partner, but I don't think it's my place to tell him that as it would go beyond friendly advice. 

I don't really know what I'm asking for advice on here - whether I'm in the wrong, whether I should tell him how I feel in a sober context on the chance he might realise his decision is wrong, or whether anybody else has been in a similar situation. The countdown to the wedding is really hurting me right now and I have no idea what to do or how to get over this when I see him every day.",t2_3f1la1i5,0,I (23F) am in love with my engaged friend (25M) who has feelings for me,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wpsr2,True,zookunft,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wpsr2/i_23f_am_in_love_with_my_engaged_friend_25m_who/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wpsr2/i_23f_am_in_love_with_my_engaged_friend_25m_who/,8849171,1682283245,0,,False,1682283255,1682283256,2023-04-23 20:54:05,,,

relationship_advice,"my bf and i have been together for a little while now. he has been a really great bf for almost the whole time we have been  together. there was one time that he exhibited a red flag and he was texting his ex in a way that made me uncomfortable and after we talked about it we decided to move forward. he willingly cut her off and changed his number. recently things have been hard, i have had a lot of family problems and have been dependent on him a lot more than i was at the start of the relationship. i can tell this is taking a toll on him and our relationship. the other night we were talking a bit back and forth about the way things feel so icky between us right now and we got to a point where he said he was confused on if he can love two people at once. he said he thinks he is still in love with his ex and he has no idea what to do about it. he knows this (our relationship) is better for him bc i am good to him, i am emotionally mature and i treat him well. he continually said he does love me, but he doesn’t know if bc he is still feeling that way if he is mature enough or even ready for a serious commitment. we have decided to take a week of space to give us clarity and we are almost at the end of the week and i still can’t really decide how i am feeling besides bad. i looked through some of his old social media posts and the way that he posted about her after their relationship was evident of the way he felt. he was posting things like he would never get over her and whoever was to come next would be nothing in comparison to what they had and that if he was to ever move on she would still be in the back of his mind. i feel so sad about the whole situation. he pursued me HARD and asked me to be his partner and i never once pressured him into doing so. he has a lot of baggage when it comes to her and i have been very open about helping him through it and i am not naïve enough to believe he had no life or emotional connection before he met me, so i want to respect those things but i don’t know if i can be a “runner up”. i guess i am asking for advice. what would you guys do if you were me? i do want to be with him, bc i truly do love him. but am i not honoring myself if i stay in this relationship?

So me and my bf spent every weekend together afterschool and sometimes during the week, and we keep getting into these arguments.

Skipping to this morning before we both had work he got pissy with me bc I played my game for like 30 mins and he started getting cold with me, we started arguing then he gave a lazy apology after.

relationship_advice,"Hi, yes this is currently ongoing and actively stressing me out.

A bit of backstory:

My gf and I have been dating for 5 years and it hasn’t been all bad. Early in our relationship, it was a big honeymoon phase. We rushed into the relationship and moved in together. Circumstantially it made sense at the time, but now I just feel like we rushed into it. 

As the relationship progressed I found out we don’t really share many hobbies. My girlfriend is a runner and a film buff where as I love musical theatre and video games. These sometimes overlap in regards to music/film but feel forced instead of natural. We rarely can go and do fun things together beyond going to a movie, theatre performance, and the occasional coffee date. Beyond hobbies, we both are stubborn and neurotic at times so we struggle to “meet in the middle” on a lot of things which leaves me to compromise most of the time. My gf can compromise too but it’s after I reach my breaking point.

Throughout the later of the five years, I’ve noticed some other things that really get under my skin. I definitely am dramatic (theatre) so I have my moments of gossip but we seem to have different levels of gossip. On one hand, I like to discuss hypotheticals on peoples lives… like people watching and storytelling but my gf will likely comment on weight, appearance, and level of personal annoyance. A situation that is stuck in my head is during a dinner party my friend and his wife invited us over. I thought it was a bit awkward but enjoyed the time. My gf make sure to note that the wife was ugly and the husband was way out of her league. That really upset me and I made sure to let her know that it upset me, yet it was not a big deal to her.

Our household chore scheme has turned into making each other feel bad for not doing a chore or two instead of helping each other out. I will do the dishes but my girlfriend will leave crusty dishes for long periods of time for me to scrape. We arranged a deal for her to do my laundry and I pay her for it. Well I’ve been out of laundry (socks n undies)many times and I’ve started my own loads only for her to get upset that I’m doing it instead of her.

Monetarily, we share rent, utilities, and food. I pay for her cellphone, laundry, and pet food/litter. I wouldn’t be stressed about this if I was reminded every time I help myself to a snack “u know I got those for me right?”.

We haven’t had actual sex in 3 years. We’ve done some sexual things rarely. When prompted, it’s usually a pain thing and that she needs to see a gyno… this has been years going on and many conversations.

I have decided we have had enough conversations and that it is time to move on but I’m worried about our two cats we share, our lease is still active until January, my gf is in her last quarter of school and I’m worried if I bring this up now she will depression slump into the abyss and fail her classes right before the school year is over. I’m not sure what the right move is or when and it’s causing me a lot of stress and sleepless nights.

Any help would be appreciated and I’m happy to clarify any details.

relationship_advice,"So we've been together over 10 years with 2 children together (2 &amp; 5 yo) and this isn't a new issue but I feel like I've reached my breaking point and I don't know how to get through to him or if there is even any point trying anymore!? (Just to add the relationship isn't exactly a happy one and we've had lots of issues over the years [no romance, no emotional support, no responsibility, lying to avoid arguments] but he always promises change and sometimes will change for a week or 2...this issue is just at the forefront at the moment)

Everyone in our lives will tell you how helpful and dependable my partner is, tonight for example he spent over 3 hours helping a friend move some paving slabs. However the man I get is completely the opposite; if I want him to help around the house I have to nag him and even then I'm lucky if he actually does it. If I ask him to do a favour (for example, pick something up for me/the kids) he'll moan he's too busy or he doesn't have time. We moved house in February (which I had to plan and organise the entire thing!) and there are still boxes everywhere which he promised he would unpack (I've done most rooms but he said he'd finish the last 2 boxes in the kitchen before April). I asked him why they haven't been done and he said he hasn't got round to it yet.

We got in to a massive row this evening and he doesn't understand why I am annoyed at all. His solution is for him to say no to other people when they ask for help but that isn't what I am trying to get across to him!! All I want is to be treated with the same respect as everyone else. To be able to depend on him to pull his weight in this relationship without me having to moan at him constantly and for me to see the happy to help side that the rest of the world seems to get. 
He has a million excuses as to why he doesn't do the things I ask, or the things he says he will do but all of them are just that - excuses. For example, he told me tonight that the reason he helps other people is because they give him instructions so he knows what to do...OK, but when I give him instructions so he knows what to do he literally called me Hitler!!! I'm not even joking.

I honestly have had enough and I know I shouldn't have let him disrespect me for so long but something happened 10 months ago which changed our lives and has shaken me mentally and I just can't be a second class citizen in my own life anymore.
Does anyone have any advice of how I can get through to him or is it better to just finally throw in the towel and walk away?",t2_iipnpwkb,0,My BF (32M) puts everyone else above me (33F),[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wpjta,True,TV_Cat-13,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wpjta/my_bf_32m_puts_everyone_else_above_me_33f/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wpjta/my_bf_32m_puts_everyone_else_above_me_33f/,8849122,1682282764,0,,False,1682282776,1682282777,2023-04-23 20:46:04,,,
relationship_advice,"I'm 19 years old (F) and in my first year of university. When I was in high school I was very reserved, even though I do like learning I didn't like school and made no effort to make contact with my peers. I had only a few friends. One of them was this very outgoing boy (around same age) who made it his quest to become my friend. It was known that he had a crush on me, but I ignored that because I valued our friendship. Secretly I also liked him a bit. But something in me held me from liking him back. I couldn't understand why he would like me, he has seen me in my most embarrassing fases and due my lack of social skills and lack of confidence I don't think I was a very good friend. He made most of the effort and I really regret how I took him for granted. He is the nicest person I've ever met and deserves so much more than me. The summer after we graduated he asked me to hang out and I accepted. We walked/biked at a local nature spot. I had a such a fun time, I don't think I've ever talked so much. When we got ready to leave he got nervous and confessed his crush on me. I freezed and couldn't respond, there was a very long silence and we both parted without saying anything. I felt so horrible, it's almost been a year and I still tear up when I think about it. Later I texted him telling him I want to stay friends and we have had no contact since (expect wishing each other a happy birthday). I really didn't want to hurt him, but I feel like I wouldn't be a good person to be in a relationship with. He is actually the first person to come this close to me and it kinda scared me. I was also a bit worried he had an image of me in his head that wasn't really me, but that's a stupid thought because we've known each other for year. I really want to explain to him that me acting that way had nothing to do with him, but I don't know how and when to do this.

relationship_advice,"So my mom 63f is addicted to drama. I hate it. It's constantly absorbing drama from TLC (the lunatic channel) to fighting with her sister/my aunt about anything. She is addicted to drama.

My dad generally doesn't have the energy to deal with it because he's busy with work or something. He will intervene but only when she starts shit that ends up in his path.

I'm m33 autistic, on disability, generally independent but there are some small things I need help with. Mainly things like a grocery trip where I have to buy a lot of heavy things and it doesn't work well with the bus. These are items that I can't get delivered.

Generally there isn't much of an issue between my mom and me but a few times and feels the need to interject herself into my life and usually it's about something in the past. She will often bring up that I called her names from long ago. I'll ask her for a specific example. She can't name one but insists that I called her something. When she does this I tell her to stop digging up the past because it's petty. But she continues to dig in.

In those situation my choices are

1. Take the lashings

2. Stand up to her but she will keep digging in and never concede my side might even have a chance of being right because she says I don't understand social things because autism. If I do stand up she will attempt to socially isolate me from my grandmother.

3. I look to my dad m59 to be the voice of reason but he doesn't want to deal with her. In a way I can't help but see him as whipped by her drama

But he kept ignoring me, untill I stood up for myself and as you can guess... That did not go well and I had to move out... My bf told me I shouldn't have said anything because"" that's just who he (my bf's father) is"". Now I live with my brother. I feel resentlent towards my bf, because he never stood up for me to his parents or friends and eventhough he has a steady job, he didn't see a need to move into our own place...
I seriously don't know if I still want to be with him... I was always open about my feelings towards him, but he didn't listen... Or ignored it... He's not a bad guy...

On the night he messaged to say he was setting off and was saving battery. (This again is fine, usually I would get a message midway but no big deal) next day I message him asking if he had a good night and some other stuff, he didn’t respond to that but replied to a separate part of the message, I got sidetracked and forgot to ask again. Today I noticed he was tagged by a female friend thanking him for the night out, he has his FB profile set so that his friends can’t see his tags I’m assuming, I only saw this post as I looked at her profile. This friend I’ve never met, he’s known her a very long time. I know he had feelings for her and made a pass at her before we met but he doesn’t know that I know that.

relationship_advice,"TDLR - ex will not stay away and I cannot stay strong enough to keep away from him. 

We (30F/36M) had a pretty short relationship. We started seeing each other October 2022. We barely made it a month when we made it official in December. We are both fearful avoidant and it has been a hell of a rollercoaster. We love each other but we are far too “broken” as people. Him more so than I because I am on my healing journey. He makes it clear that he will not work to heal himself or even be together (his actions not his words). 

I go no contact and end things over and over again. He keeps coming back. I was not strong enough to not let him back. We had broken up for 2.5 months. I healed. I found peace. I let him back and I feel destroyed again. Not even by him anymore because I knew better. It’s hard because I love him, but I also know the chaos, drama, and unpredictability he brings, brings the feel of normalcy into my life (reflective of my childhood) however I cut him off but he always comes back days, weeks, even months. 

He says he loves me but I’m too good for him, he is not enough for me, and I will leave him anyways which “I have already done” but he fails to realize not by choice because he cannot meet me in the middle so we can meet each others needs. I lean anxious, he leans avoidant, I lean avoidant, he leans anxious. It’s too much. I called it quits again. I know that as much as we love each other it is not enough. Yet, it’s hard for him to stay away and hard for me to keep him away. I know what I need to do. Yet, I don’t know why it’s so hard to do it. Why seek me out if this was what it was going to be the whole time? I just don’t understand.

He’s not a player type. He stated we had the same goals, values, etc. however his actions speak otherwise and were he said he was willing to meet for communication, emotion, etc. was not accurate. He models poor communication and emotionally immaturity plus he has a a lot of trauma both childhood and romantic relationship wise.",t2_cyj7mwfh,0,My (30F) ex (36M) keeps coming back.,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wpabr,True,Mixedbeauty30,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wpabr/my_30f_ex_36m_keeps_coming_back/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wpabr/my_30f_ex_36m_keeps_coming_back/,8849074,1682282264,0,,False,1682282278,1682282279,2023-04-23 20:37:44,,,

relationship_advice,"Tldr: i’m seeing a guy (25M) who escaped russia. I recently found out that a very close friend of him he keeps mentioning is a 53 yo guy. They sleep in the same bed when he visits him (which is every 2-3 week) and the older guy’s possibly bisexual/gay. I’m concerned that he’s taking advantage of him being alone in a foreign country. I like him but his relationship with this older guy doesn’t look innocent to me.
______________________

I’ve (28F) been talking to this guy Andrei (25M) for a while online and a couple days ago we had our first date. Everything went perfect and he looks like a good guy. We’ll definitely be seeing each other.

I live in germany. he escaped the mandatory mobilisation in russia and seeks asylum in germany. He lives in a different city, kinda far away, right on the border of a neighbour state but he said he comes to my city quite often because a friend of his lives here. 

He mentioned this friend -Lukas- a few times and said they are pretty close friends. Lukas helped him come to germany, apply for asylum and even opened a bank account under his own name but for Andrei, as russians are currently having trouble opening a bank account. He helps him A LOT.

At first i didn’t think anything of it, close friends help each other out so what, right?

But at our date he told me some weird things that made me feel uncomfortable. Turns out Lukas is a 53 year old dude, doesn’t have a family - no spouse, no girlfriend. Lukas’ explanation is he used to work too much that he kinda forgot about dating and now it’s too late. Andrei told me he thinks Lukas is bisexual. 

And at some point Lukas actually thought Andrei was gay but Andrei explained him he was straight. 

He also told me they sleep in the same bed when Andrei visits him because Lukas has only one bed at his place. 

Andrei visits him every 2 weeks or so and stays 3-4 days each time from what i understood. Andrei takes the train halfway to my city and from there Lukas picks him up with his car which is about 30-40km. 

When andrei was supposed to be tranfered to another city far away Lukas showed up, talked to some people and cancelled the transfer so that he could be relocated to this border city he lives now, which is the closest city in his state to ours. (He’s only allowed to reside in that state). 

To me this sounds like this Lukas guy has a big crush on Andrei. More concerningly, They met in 2012, when Andrei was 14-15 years old and they stayed in contact ever since. Which is a huge red flag in my opinion. I don’t think it’s very innocent when a man in his 40’s befriends an underage boy.

We only met each other once in person, which was a couple days ago, but it already feels like we’re a good match for each other. He is very into me and i’m into him. But i’m kinda concerned. I feel like Lukas is taking advantage of his situation because Andrei is completely alone in germany and only knows Lukas.

I know we just met and it’s not my place to warn him about his friend of 10 years but i’m genuinely concerned. Should I express my concern?

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I started dating in November and went ‘official’ in December. He’s regularly active on his social media (mostly instagram) and is posting stories and of himself doing sports or hanging out/partying with his friends.

I just don’t understand why he’s not posting anything of me and him on his page. It makes me feel invisible or like he’s hiding to the world (of previous dates and so on that he’s still following) that he’s in a relationship. It makes me feel hurt when I think about it in that way.

relationship_advice,"

I've just turned 18 and I have 3 siblings all older than. My parents(49F &amp; 45M) are also foster parents to 4 kids who are now adults and have moved out. My parents and me have a difficult relationship and this is also true of my siblings (my biological bros &amp; sis as I don't count the others as family) and we're close. However, thier foster kids and mom &amp; dad get on like a house on fire. 

Growing up for me and my siblings was hard. We were never prioritised at all by my parents. Everything revolved around thier precious foster children. Nearly all of thier time outside work involved meetings with social workers and children's services etc. The ironic thing is that my mom and dad neglected thier own kids to care for other people's. 

My brothers and sisters have experienced traumatic things in our lives that we've never shared with my parents because they didn't have time and quite honestly they don't care about us. I won't share my sibs traumas but I was bullied to such as extent that I was self harming regularly and found issues with my mental health. My brothers and sisters were amazing getting me support and helping me. Throughout our lives we've grown to resent our parents. I particularly despise my mother. She's a selfish, sanctimonious bitch. 

We had to suffer a family dinner with them and my family. These are always awkward. Mom &amp; dad seemed happy about something. I was praying 'not another foster kid' in head and heart over and over. 
Turns out they were going to some award ceremony that evening and they'd been nominated for some fostering award by thier foster brats. This put me in an absolute rage. My sister sent me a text from across the table to go outside and calm down. I stayed in the garden until they left and then went to the living room to watch TV with the other. You could cut the tension with a knife. 

My parents came home slightly drunk clutching a crap piece of metal. Yes, they won whatever stupid fostering award. They stumbled into the living room, shoved the crap in my lap and collapsed into the couch opposite.

The red mist descended. I threw the p.o.s at the wall. I could feel my heart pumping and my body shaking with rage. I'd had enough. I screamed at them asking why should shit, neglectful parents be praised? My parent just gawped in shock at me. I walked up and down the room and told them both what we really think and feel. What I've been through and what the others had been through (I know this wasn't for me to share). My mother burst into tears and my father just went silent and deflated. My siblings didn't attempt to stop me. I was saying everything we'd all bottled for years. I vented how much I hated those foster kids, how much I despised them both, especially my mom. How we didn't want them in my life any more. I asked my sister if I could move in with her. She said yes and asked me to get my stuff. I just told her fuck my stuff and left.

That was a month ago. I've enjoyed living with my sister and things seem a little better. She's given me a job at her company in a different department to her and its a new challenge. 

My parents have been sending hand written letters to us all, emails etc. Saying how much they were sorry and loved us. In one my mom called me her baby. It made me sick. Its far too late and I just want them to go away and don't contact me. My sisters been reading hers and believes I need to slow down before making decisions. She also says I need to at least hear from them properly. In thier letters to us all they suggested counselling as a family and with them on our own e.g. me, them and a therapist. I don't want to waste my time any further. My brother has said they look really rough too.

relationship_advice,"TL;DR at end

So this coworker (30m) and I (30f) haven’t been too close over the years, but in recent times (the last few months or so) we’ve gotten much closer because we work the same shift. We have the same work friends, and we had seen each other outside of work a few times. Well, recently I started developing deeper feelings for him and it seemed like they were mutual for a time. And they still do sometimes, but I’m getting really mixed signals from him. He’ll say cutesy things and remember a lot of things about me and tease and such which are great signs and he’ll seek me out to chat. We went out to a game one night and we had amazing conversation and we were laughing and chatting the whole time and he told me he had great night. But sometimes he can be very cold. Somedays he seeks me out and we chat and laugh and other days his body language can be closed off and it seems almost like he’s cold shouldering me (which is how he treats most people. He’s a very stoic man) and now when I invite him out he’s busy with other things and doesn’t make efforts to hang out with me. But after we finish working on this project we have to work on together he’ll stand there and want to chat instead of leave and he fidgets the whole time. I can tell he wants to talk but I think he’s a little awkward and doesn’t know what to talk about? So I assume he’s not into me anymore, which I’m fine with, and I give him his space and do my own thing, but then he’ll seek me out and say wonderful things and then I get very confused given the mixed signals. I think he may be confused, I know he has next to no experience with women through a mutual friend. I’m not sure how to approach the situation. Any advice would be welcomed. I’d love to have a conversation with him outside of work and one on one, but he’s I think also not giving me the opportunity to. (He’s very much a homebody and friends even have trouble getting him out of the house, it’s very rare) I’ve tried to invite him out one on one in both public and private settings and the answers no, I try to invite him out with friends that I know he’s comfortable with and the answer is no. I just don’t know what to do. It’s very jarring for me. I’m very interested but I don’t want to make him or me uncomfortable. Especially at work. Anyway, thanks for reading if you made it this far!

TL;DR: I really like my coworker, and sometimes I think he likes me too but he’s giving mixed signals and I don’t know what to do or how to talk to him about it especially because I don’t want to talk to him about it at work but he’s a homebody and doesn’t like to leave the house much.",t2_hizfuthc,0,I (30F) have strong feelings for coworker (30M) but they’re sending very mixed signals.

relationship_advice,"We started talking online, and almost instantly became friends. We had a really strong friendship for one and a half year before deciting that we want to be together.

In our first year together we really completed each other. Everything was amazing.

In our second year there were some tense moments that nearly ended our relationship. Most of them becouse Covid hit, and we couldn't meet each other for 6 months, and she wasn't too active online due to family reasons so we couldn't really talk then. After that we had some arguments that continued well into our third year tohether. 

Most of these were only based around my insecurities (though I didn't know much about them then), and could have been avoided, but somehow I just lost myself and this led to the end of our relationship after 3 and a half years of being together. (We still had great times together during these times that we truly treasured, but there were just too many arguments, and we couldn't spend much time together sadly. I believe that more time together, and a bit of tolerance could have saved our relationship)

I wanted to add that we never really argued in person. Somehow we always felt good and safe around each other, so the bigest issue was the long distance part, and not being avilable online.

None of us cheated or anything like that. We were always looked at each other with respect and honesty, and I know for a fact that she would have cut off her leggs before betraying me like that.

We still talk daily, and when something happens I'm the first person she talks with (And that goes for me too). We still share basically almost everything with each other. The only major change was that we are no longer together.

I'm really confused about my feelings, becouse a part of me really wants to get back with her.  
When we broke up we even agreed that we are open to try it again if something starts to develop between us again, but she stated that she didn't want a relationship then (not with me or anyone else). To my knowlege that statement about not wanting a relationship still stands, but I don't know how she feels about the thought of starting again with me.

I'm really trying to move on with my life and basically ''go with the flow''. Sometimes it's actually nice, but sometimes I just feel conflicted with my own feelings, and I just really want give her a hug  and hold her hand just like we used to do back then...

relationship_advice," I apologize for this being so long a lot has happened.

So my boyfriend of a year and a half broke up with me Friday. He’s been really depressed because he moved to a program to get his GED and it’s been really stressful for him and he also started smoking weed again that week after quitting for like 6 months. He was canceling on me a lot  he said it was just because he’s been depressed but recently he’s been making more excuses of him having to get things done. I have pretty severe anxiety and I’m really attached to him so I was asking him if we were okay and if he needs me to be doing anything and if he still loves me and wants to be with me and every time he was really reassuring and was like ofc I still love you It’s not you I’ve just been struggling. Anyway he broke up with me Friday because he said he feels like we’ve been growing apart. I can see why he feels that way because I’ve been a little more distant because he’s been canceling so much and hasn’t been the same. But I don’t get why he never said anything sooner especially with me asking him quite a bit.  I’ve been begging him to stay and for us to try to get this better but he’s been saying he can’t rn and maybe in the future but it’s just not working for him rn and all that stuff. 

Now to more of the very recent issue -

Last night I was texting him because I saw he followed a few girls and I was really upset because I don’t get how you could move on that fast and I was trying to get him to talk to me and explain how he could move on so fast and if I ever meant anything to him and he’s like it’s not a good time, I’m not thinking right right now, can we talk tmm. Then I saw he posted on his story, he was at a party.. drinking, he’s an alcoholic he’s been sober since September. He is someone who can not drink casually, it gets really bad really fast. I was already mad because of the girls but that just broke my heart and I was telling him you can’t do this to yourself and I’m not going to just sit here and watch you fuck your life up and I care about you and I know you deserve more then to do this to yourself again. I never got a response and I’ve been trying to get him to text me or respond to my calls today too

Which leads me to my problem. Hes done this before, hes broken up with me and tried to push me away a number of times because he’s been depressed and just needed space but he’s always come back. He also mentioned a while ago after a “break up” that he was really grateful that I’m always there for him that I don’t let him go when he gets like this. So idk if he’s serious this time. The one other time he followed other girls was during a really bad fight and we actually broke up for a bit and he was talking to other girls. He’s really all I have he’s my best friend and I love him more then anything and I really will do whatever it takes not to loose him. I really don’t know if I should just give up and let him go or try to be there for him because ik he’s not okay. I also understand how toxic this is but it’s something I can tolerate especially because ik how it feels to be in so over your head you don’t know what to do and push everyone away. If this is something that’s temporary we will be having a big conversation about communication and that I can not do this again and how we could work to prevent this from happening again.",t2_6n9228kc,0,I really need advice.

relationship_advice,"I went on a date that I thought went super well. I may have shown a little bit insecurity. Later in the date he sat by me which I loved because I thought it was a good sign.

As we left I looked at him while he walked me to his car and we kissed. He asked before the date if he could kiss me and I said we will see how it goes lol. We make out more in the elevator. 

Once were to my car, I drive him to his . We miss more and debate if we should go to my place and I said mine was off limits. He said we would be making out for hours. He looked in deep thought. He showed me a few songs he likes. And then decided we shouldn’t do anything else. 

Before we met he said I’d be bad for his sleep so I don’t know if that’s connected. Anyway he reached out to see me and I told him my availability and he picked a day from that. I said OK sounds good since it was going to be the next day and then I said what time works for you, and no reply. 

This was about four or five days ago And he deleted his bumble account yesterday or today. And yes, I know it was deleted and he didn’t unmatch.

I would like to hear your thoughts on reaching out to someone who seemed very interested, but then stopped . I’m thinking of saying some thing like. “Hey!

relationship_advice,"
Hi 
I so when I was doing my undergrad I had a huge crush on a girl (24F). We used to talk a lot, had a lot of things in common, but I never used to make a move on her. A lot of mutual friends and one of them also liked her. At the end of the undergrad I finally summoned up my courage and asked her, she rejected it. Or honestly she put it in a way that she sees me as a friend but it was not clear. She did or used to behave more than a friend or idk if it's my bias actually because I want to see things that way.
Eg. She got me stuff from an abroad trip, she didn't bring one to any other guy, she used to talk for hours when we were close. It's been more than 4 years now and she still makes an effort to wish me on my birthdays. 


Currently I am in a relationship with another person. Honestly it's going good and bad. We dont have much things in common, but we both have an understanding. We like spending time together and i love the efforts she puts in. Bad part includes we have constant fighting, being moody, and lack of things in common to do. She is a bit insecure abt this undergrad friend that I had. We don't talk anymore apart from just birthday wishes and a catchup that's it.

Now I am not sure what I should do here, should I for once and for all for the final time ask this undergrad girl whether we could have been anything more than friends? Or leave that thought at bay and focus on my relationship with the person I am with.

relationship_advice,"Me and my ex gf dated for 2 months and throughout these months we were faced with trauma and arguments and a lot of these arguments were based off of actual trauma from other relationships, she broke up with her ex last year in August and started dating me in February. 

So to today, we broke up and we both tried to find solutions to not breaking up, and she said that she just needs some time alone to really fix herself and her problems and then she reassured me that her feelings won’t change and that we will be exclusive to each other and that we shouldn’t distance from each other rather we should be friends and remain close and I told her that I loved her and that I don’t want anyone else, she said that she didn’t want to hold me back from being happy 

I was also telling her that no one else can fill her spot and that I want her and only her and she said she feels the same way, there’s no exes on her phone, no new guys, she said that she’s working on herself and not going to go after guys, we live in different towns as well so

relationship_advice,"Basically we stopped having sex because she says that she doesn't feel anything in general down there .
We can have sex for 20 minutes with her cumming a few times but she doesn't feel anything really she says .
And so she only does it because I want to do it and due to this I stopped wanting to do it with her because I don't want to make her do something just because I want to do it , don't want to use her to just satiate my sexual desires .
And even though I'm okay with the situation I have an extremely high sex drive so I resort to pleasing myself .

The problem I have and where I need help is that , she does get horny and does get aroused to the point where she will please herself next to me in bed but she doesn't want anything to do with me . 

We went from neck kissing and doing everything to now she doesn't even want neck kisses because it's turns her on and she doesn't want that .

And I've asked if it's something I'm doing or if there is something I can do to help but she says that it's natural for some woman to just not feel anything from sex and I understand but then when she alianates me basically and pleases herself next to me it makes me feel shit because we have no sex life together anymore .

relationship_advice,"     I’ll keep it sweet; however there is a lot of dense material. 

     We have been together for three years, and it has had it’s up and downs. I thought it was normal until the past few months I’ve questioned quite near everything. I noticed I was isolated from my family and friends (although it feels like I did that to myself), and recently have been able to love myself better. We’re really toxic towards each other nowadays with what feels like resentment on both sides I think. She chooses her family over me and so we’ve just-drifted. We still live together but I’ve grown increasingly distant. There’s alot of physical abuse, emotional abuse and verbal abuse towards me and I’ve begun to develop unhealthy coping mechanisms…to include cheating. 
     Last night, I tried comforting her since she called out of work and was feeling severely depressed. I let her know that I still was going to work tomorrow early, so if I doze off that I’m sorry. She began crying and shoving me away, then went to the bathroom. I sat outside the door asking to be let in, then she swung the door open and dropped to her knees. She slit her wrists-again. I showered jer and after she began to verbally attack me again while trying to talk things through with her and I got up and said I needed to cool down and was going to come back when we could talk without anger.

relationship_advice,"
Let me start off by the news I received from her (25F) was suddenly dumped on me one day. All up until that point she’s been acting normally, no hints or behavior that would be point to her breaking up with me. 

For the past month she has been emotionally cheating on me (26M) by not telling me that she developed feelings for another person that she met in a group of friends a month ago prior. The entire month she was talking to her friends and her family about it and not telling me what’s going on. Keep in mind that we live 4hrs away in different cities but I visit her every 2 months. We also moved together from one country to another.

The person that hung out in that group was hitting on her and even tried to kiss her (30M). She refused and told me everything. Low and behold I wouldn’t know that that would be the same guy she developed feelings for later. She broke up with me and a day later she “half” slept with the guy. She couldn’t do it all the way because I quote: she felt disgusted and couldn’t go on with it. They talked and then she went home.

Anyways, she admitted to everything when I asked her on the phone. Right now I feel hurt, betrayed and sick to my stomach. We didn’t meet up in person yet because we’re both taking time for it. I just want answers as to why jeopardize your almost 4 year relationship to be with a dude you just met recently? I’m also feeling lost, confused and downright emotionally destroyed 

Throughout years I never had any doubts or suspicions about my gf cheating on me nor did she ever show interest in other guys like that. However she is a very extroverted person and likes to go to raves, she doesn’t do drugs or drink.

relationship_advice,"hi all.

i was hoping to get a little advice about a short-term relationship of around 2 months which has just come to an end very unexpectedly.

bit of background: previous to this short relationship, i was with an ex for thirteen years. only a few short months later, after some expeditious therapy, quite out of nowhere i met this new - very special - woman, who i will call _jane_ for the purposes of this post. jane had just come out of something similar: 6 months single, 15 years with her ex and a child from this previous relationship. we are both in our thirties.

i wasn't relationship-ready after my long-term separation, and neither was jane - we were both very clear about this at the very beginning.

but then we met and we burned bright--every second in eachother's company felt incredibly special. after a month or so of casually - but also exclusively - dating eachother, we were both delighted to make it official one evening late last month.

everything about this relationship was just perfect, albeit totally unexpected at such a weird juncture in both of our lives. we resisted the temptation to live in eachother's pockets, meeting a 2-3 times a week; we were out and about often when they did, enjoying a social life together; i had met her friends, family and son and vibed hard with them all; the sex was incredible, the best we had both experienced in our lives; the love language was on point, we exchanged thoughtful gifts and gestures... basically there was nothing amiss. 

i had done a little dating before meeting jane which, as i expected, amounted to nothing more than friendships - i guess i wasn't ready at that point. but when i met jane, who had also said she wasn't relationship-ready in the beginning, everything changed for us both. almost immediately, we had this incredibly special connection - constantly joking and laughing, sharing the sort of intimate moments one might expect several months, even a year, into a relationship, and truly missed eachother when we were apart.

anyway, jane started suffering from fatigue and got ill a few times. she said she felt burnt out. being a single working mum, trying to hold down a house and balance other commitments was hard at the best of times, but when i entered the picture she was stretched to her limits. she went from going to bed most nights at 9pm before meeting me to often staying up into the early hours of the morning.

then her cat died. it was pretty horrific and involved watching the cat be put down. this moment was pretty seismic for jane, dredging up all sorts of emotions which she had presumably suppressed, but reached a natural venting through this experience. a few quiet days later, she writes to me to inform me that she can't do it anymore--i am everything she could've ever asked for in a boyfriend - perfect, she says - but she just doesn't have the time, energy or resources to maintain a relationship and give me the attention/engagement that she feels i deserve.

given how everything was so peachy between us, i take her at her word with her reasoning. unlike in my younger years, i make a conscious decision not to resist or challenge the break-up. i decide to be stoic about it all. no tears, no protestations... i tell her i love her, for the first time, and it's a sad day, but that if she ever feels ready to reconnect in the future and can figure out a way we could make it work for her, and us both, i'd like to hear from her.

it's been nearly a week and i had one heartfelt message from her explaining how sorry she was, how this is no reflection on me, how she wished we had met in a few month's time when the dust has settled on her house sale and she has found her feet again.

anyway, idk what to think. my original plan before i met jane was to move away and by some weird serendipitous series of events i ended up meeting her instead. i put my life in a state of arrested development while the relationship flourished. now, ofc, i'm jane-less so the plan goes ahead... i move away, and she's aware this is a possibility within the month.

i guess the advice i am seeking is thus:

is there any mileage in making anymore contact with jane in a month or so, assuming i am still local and thinking about her? or is it enough that she knows i love her, that i'm interested in exploring options with her and have welcomed her to contact me if she wants to discuss?

i care very deeply about her, and i've never in my life had this deep consummate connection with a woman, but i'm also aware - very aware - that i don't want to chase a situation which ultimately requires space, time to breathe etc. i feel like i already know the answers to the questions - that i need to leave her alone, carry on with my life, and if she decides she has resolved her own life stuff then we can give it another go - but i'm willing to hear other opinions.

relationship_advice,"So, I've been talking to this girl since 2019. She lives in Venezuela, I'm in America. We weren't ""official"" or anything, just talked a lot. I noticed she was following me on social media and thought she was pretty, so I sent her a message. She was really shy at first but I coaxed her into talking to me. I ask if we can be exclusive while having a long distance relationship, but she declines.

Fastforward a few years. She's visiting friends in Miami, FL. I ask if I can come see her, and she agrees. We hang out, and I ask her if we can make it official. She says yes.

A friend of mine (call her Sarah) says my gf is just using me to get a green card. Now I'm paranoid about it.

Evidence she is using me:

1. She lives in Venezuela and I'm in the States.

2. We became official after hanging out for a few days, which she even remarked on as being kind of fast. Although we did talk for a few years prior.

3. I know she was talking to a lawyer about finding ways to stay in the US before I offered to come meet her.

4. I've been told that a long con that takes years is very common.

Evidence against: 

1. She has an EU passport (b/c her dad is Greek) and family in Greece/Spain/Switzerland. So she could go to Europe if she just wanted to escape Venezuela.

2. We've fought and argued heatedly several times over the years. She's not 100% sweet all the time.

3. I had to cajole her into letting me visit and she was very hesitant.

4. I mentioned possibly moving to Greece with her instead of the States and she seems open to the idea.

So one of two things is true: either she's very subtly playing the long game to get a green card, or I'm just letting my friend's advice make me paranoid. I'd like to date her for a while, visit her in Europe (she will hopefully be moving there soon) and maybe marry her eventually.

relationship_advice,"A few months ago, my partner (M40) aired out some of his feelings to his own dad (M60+) by text. Due to the sensitive timing, this completely blew up. His dad didn't even respond to my partner's text and straight up ghosted him.

We soon found out that my partner's 2 sisters had also ghosted him (without saying anything) which has led to a very awkward situation for me. 

My partner and I are expecting our first child and this conflict happened right before our reveal that we wanted to share with family. Only his mum joined in which I appreciated, but I feel personally hurt that no one in my partner's family said anything to me. They've indirectly ghosted me too.

I'm very upset by this whole situation. The idea of ghosting seems so childish to me whatever the reason. Perhaps something you do to strangers but never to family no matter the conflict. You can be upset, you can disagree, but never in my right mind would I consider blocking a family member (especially my son or a sister??) out of my life. Especially not when there is a baby to be born. 

I'm upset with my partner, because despite him having good intentions he absolutely ruined the family dynamic by being blunt and not considering timing. However, I'm most upset by his dad being too childish to talk it out (he's f*cking 60+, be an adult) and his sisters shunning him over something that isn't even about them? The ghosting by his dad and one particular sister is also not new, they've done this to my partner before. This is a massive concern, cause it leaves me wondering if I personally even want them to reconcile. I don't want to introduce my own child to this sort of behavior and I don't want to surround myself with people I can't rely on. My partner is very black-and-white about it: his father is dead to him and he won't talk to his siblings unless they apolagize. Fair enough. But that also means he no longer has a family.

I'm not the only one pregnant; his sister is expecting her 2nd a month before me. She is almost due and I'm very conflicted in how to deal with it. She invited me to her babyshower (only time I've heard from her), but I politely said that unless she and my partner can resolve their issues I wasn't comfortable attending. She said she had no intention of resolving anything with my partner and took me off the list.

I'm very very conflicted how to handle the birth of her baby. I would be deeply hurt myself if they didn't congratulate me or at least said something after the birth of my child. She is giving birth before me tho, which makes me feel I should do the same to her. Even when I don't think she deserves it. My MIL said she might give birth within 2 weeks due to some complications in her pregnancy.

It's not my place to meddle in this. I'd love to see things resolved but don't see it happening. Not sure what advice I'm looking for but this has a great impact in our lives since my own family doesn't live close. Is it worth fixing this or should I just burry it like everyone else?

relationship_advice,"not officially in a relationship by the way, been seeing each other for a few weeks and were friends for a year or two before that, but it’s going really well and we like each other a lot.

idk if im just not emotionally available enough but whenever my new bf is nice to me i struggle to accept it. he does all these very gentlemanly things, opens doors for me, pulls out my chair for me, compliments me, always respectful, i was having trouble deciding on what i wanted to eat and he came up with all these options i might like, he scraped the ice off my windshield so i wouldnt have to do it late at night when i left his place one time, etc etc etc. just so nice and thoughtful. and not even in a desperate overbearing way like some people do, he has boundaries but always shows he cares how im feeling. he is a nice guy generally too (we hung out a good amount before we started dating) so it doesn’t feel like a love bombing type of situation which ive been in before.

im just struggling so much with accepting his kindness and attention. my ex never did anything for me, always ditched, never paid attention to me when i needed it. my previous ex did too much for me and expected sex in return. now im with this guy ive known for a while as a friend and he just cares so much and is being so emotionally open and i don’t know if i can accept his support.

it doesn’t help that i graduate college in two weeks and will be moving several states away back to my parents’ house and im too busy to even think about if we should pursue a long term thing or not. everything hinges on my emotional unavailability.

relationship_advice,"Bare with me I’m gonna have to take the long way round. I’ll start with my best friend, we’ll call him Jeff. So I changed schools a lot as a kid and once I got to the school I graduated from I was in 5th grade. Now being the new kid and moving a bunch I didn’t get to keep friends for very long, but Jeff instantly welcomed me. After school we would played video games and as we got older we started going on camping trips and stuff like that. Jeff quickly became one of my best friends and at this point is my brother. I mean hell he even got me my first long term job. 

When I moved out of my parents house I ended up moving in with Jeff and have been living with him and his brothers for a year and a half now. Things have been great, I’m obviously very close with Jeff, and now I’ve gotten super close with his brothers Mike and Scott. Currently it’s all 4 of us living in an apartment together, a bit hectic since it’s a 3 bedroom but good none the less. 

Let’s get to the meat and potatoes of this whole situation with Jeff’s sister Alice. So since moving in I’ve met and gotten to know Alice a bit more. She’s always super nice to me, at work she smiles and stops to chat (we all work in the same building). She’ll pop into my room and say hey if she’s at the apartment. She’s let me use her car for moving stuff (I have a sports car with no space). She makes small compliments that make me feel good. There have been a couple moments when I’ve been intoxicated and felt cared for by her. It sounds dumb but she relaxes if I’m stressed and she makes me feel good about myself. 

Now I’ve been wondering if she likes me and if so what the hell I do with that. Some of you might say well she’s just being a good human and being nice to you. Ooo but wait there’s more that’s left my head stuck in a spiral. Alice has made comments to me that I have no idea what to do with. At work we were talking, laughing and she made a joke or comment under her breath that I could have sworn was, “well I have a number too.” She has gotten super close to me after she’s asked me to explain something to her. She made a comment in a whole break room that she likes working with me because “she gets to play with all my toys and equipment,” while looking me up and down. And just now when she left the apartment. She was walking out with a group of people, everyone was saying goodbye and she says “I love you (my name).”

I have no idea what I want to do with this situation let alone if there’s any weird obligations I have since she’s my best friends sister. I don’t think Mike would care, Scott might and I feel like Jeff does. He’s physically picked her up and moved her back once before when she was talking closely with me xD. I don’t know how I even feel. I think about her consistently, she’s been in dreams about life stuff like buying cars or houses. I’m just confused and don’t know how to move forward.

relationship_advice,"I’ve been talking to this guy I met online. We’ve been on a couple dates and he asked me to be his girlfriend on the last one. I said yes. Yesterday, we hung out at his house and twice he initiated some making out. I was sitting on his lap the first time and the second time he was putting his hand in my shorts. So that made me think he wanted to do a little more, so I asked him if he wanted me to do anything for him. He became visibly upset and we stopped and just sat in silence until he took me home. He acted the same on a previous date but that moment didn’t incite a period of silence between us like it has this time. Every time I try to ask what the problem is, he says there is none.

Anyway, I texted him when I was home and said, “I'm sorry I made you uncomfortable. I shouldn't have been so direct. I understand if you are not interested in seeing me again. Drive safe.” No response. A few hours later I said, “I’m genuinely so sorry. I just thought you wanted more because you were putting your hand in my shorts. I guess I just assume making out always has to lead to that because that’s how it was in my last relationship. You really mean a lot to me and I'm sorry for making things awkward.”

It’s the next day and still no response. I really like him but we are both pretty shy and I guess that’s a problem for us. Despite this, I still try to be as communicative as possible and he is not offering the same honesty. And I feel that what I’ve done is minuscule compared to the fact that he never told me he had a child at the beginning of the relationship. I want to keep being with him but I don’t know what to do/say.

relationship_advice,"Firstly, sorry for my english, but I don't know another place for an another opinion. I don't know, that i must to do.

I’m in a long distance relationship. So, we have known each other for a long time and communicate well. I really fall in love, bcs he's interesting man. I think, that he's too and we can spen time with good mood together. He's finishing his first year of education in uni. He has a work, where isn't so high salary. I graduated from university few years ago and am now working. 

He has one problem - he's afraid to say he's love me. Not important, how i got this information (from his friends), but as I understand, he is afraid that our age difference is five years and he gets much less than me. He doesn't want to burden me. My problem is that i afraid parents, who might not approve our relationships. They don't know about my bf and i don't want to lose they, because when I joked about the situation, we had a serious quarreling. So, they took it as if they understood everything. 

I really don't know what to do. Mb there are people who have saw this problem in a relationship. I love him, i sure, that he love me, but mb this is all wrong and we should just stay friends. I really don't know. It's so difficult.

tldr: I don't know whether to tell my parents about our relationship and whether it is worth starting first. Perhaps it is worth waiting a little and then he will make the main step himself.

relationship_advice,"So I've been meeting him for 4 months (and that's how long I've known him for). We'd meet once a week on average. It was good at the beginning but after some time he turned out to have some views that bothered me (feminist hate, weird attitude to gay people/people dressing up in an alternative way, mansplaining, always proving me I'm wrong, being critical of me) and I just couldn't fall for him, even though I tried, so I decided to end it. I've never considered it as some kind of love relationship, more of the phase when I get to know him, so I decided to inform him via message, as I didn't want to waste his time making him go to the centre and giving him a false hope for a date just to tell him 'sorry but I don't feel that'

Ofc he was sad, he asked me if I wanted to cut the contact off and that he was sad I wanted to do so. I just told him it will be the best way (I really believe it's better for him, even before there were some situations when he'd ignore me telling him I'm not comfortable with something he says to me, so I think he might think he still has any chance). He tried to prolong the conversation but I cut it. And then the circus started

Fortunately, it isn't a very bad circus. It takes place mostly in social media - fire emoji reactions to my stories, unfollowing and following me back for several times, yesterday he even texted me on facebook to apologize for unfriending me and to tell me I can add him if I wanted to with no hesitation and he won't be mad if I didn't respond (yeah, and a day after that he did the unfollow-follow shit again). Ofc I didn't add him again, I want him to move on. I feel weird because, for me, 4 months of knowing someone isn't that much and he seems to be acting just like I truly broke up with him. We didn't even kiss, as I refused him to do so

Should I do sth about that? Or just ignore him?

relationship_advice,"

So we were together for 3 months, it was a long distance relationship. 
It all started very romantically - we met in Erasmus exchange program and had 10 days together to get to know each other. We fell in love madly, and it was my first mutual love experience, meaning it was my first relationship in general.

There were so many great things. We shared some interests, finally finding someone who understands my passions and always supporting me was a heavenly feeling.
He always showed tons of love, told the most beautiful things to me, we had a great chemistry.

But as it escalated, i started noticing one difference after another. I have to be honest, due to no experience in dating scene i probably had rosy glasses on and all the problems hit me like a truck (multiple trucks).

First came the differences in our views on LGBTQ folks rights. As I'm pansexual, I obviously care very much about discrimination and fighting for equality. While he was not homophobic, due to his religion he was not supportive of the community and as it got clear later, didn't want me to do much, any activism, so we could stay ""on the middle ground"". 

From there goes the second - religions. I'm an atheist, he's Muslim. While we didn't push our views on each other and respected them, I noticed that it really puts a negative point in the relationship. Everytime we discussed something, it would eventually get to our views on world, where they went different ways. At first, i thought that it's okey and doesn't matter much. But with time i recognized in myself that I'm starting to get distant from him and don't really enjoy our talks anymore, as we didn't share a lot of views on how people should behave, what roles hold people in relationships. I was getting tired from all this.

Third, even though he would always be interested in what i feel, what's going on in my mind and life, he was not a great listener. He would never fully understand how i felt, and he wouldn't listen. It always came to simple ""i like apples, because..."" and in response ""ah well i don't like apples, i like grapes, let me explain you why grapes are more important to me"". While it seemed okay, it always ended on him telling that i just think too much and should care about different things that are ""more important"". 

Eventually I understood that it's not gonna work, even if we love each other so much. As I was explaining to him all the reasons I don't feel safe or free in our relationship, he would simply say that I'm picking and choosing all the little bad stuff in him and making him hate himself to make myself feel better. His stance was, that if two people love each other, nothing else matters, and all the views, values and opinions should be on the second plan and it's okey to give them up for love. 

So it's the first day after break-up. We agreed to stay friends, as i really like him as a person, regardless all the stupid stuff he did in a relationship. But now I'm conflicted whether or not should I - a lot of people told me that he has benn controlling and manipulative from what I told them and that u shouldn't stay friends with him. Should I forget about him and move on or i can stay friends, as all the problems that were present in a relationship will disappear? Should I just close my eyes to everything he did?..

tl;dr: i broke with my boyfriend due to our differences in views on gay rights, as well as me not feeling safe and free to share my opinions and values with him, and now I'm conflicted on whether or not we should stay friends.",t2_a8let226,0,"I (18F) broke up with my boyfriend (21M) due to our differences and his controlling behavior, should we stay friends?",[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wmhhv,True,RevolutionaryCare468,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wmhhv/i_18f_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_21m_due_to_our/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wmhhv/i_18f_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_21m_due_to_our/,8848515,1682277024,0,,False,1682277041,1682277042,2023-04-23 19:10:24,,,

But she’s made it clear to him that she does want to get engaged and have a party. He did give a ring a year ago but he said it wasn’t an engagement ring when she asked.

relationship_advice,"me and my ex were dating for the past 1.5 years. over the past few months, things have been pretty rocky and i found us arguing over little things, like certain plans or dumb things such as coffee. last weekend, he broke up with me for the second time. it wasn’t really unexpected because we were arguing that day and he was like “ I’m bringing you home, I’m done with your shit”. and i was really hurt and pleading with him not to leave and he kept saying “ no, im sorry but I’m done”.

it sucks. for some context, we both are 20 and 21, in our third year of college. our bond was so great, we were literal best friends, did everything together and we had so many jokes and memories i never even had with anyone else. this was my first real relationship that was long. when we first started dating two years ago, it went really well for 3 months, we were in that “honeymoon” phase and always were with eachother. gradually over time, he got busy with work and school and his fraternity, so that causes a lot of distance which ended up in him breaking up with me to “focus on himself”. before we broke up that first time, and he said “i know we’ll get back together in the future” which we did. he went to a fraternity party as a pledge and met this girl in a sorority. they exchanged instagrams, snapchats, and tiktoks, but he said it was just to make a new friend. at first, i was iffy about it, but i shrugged it off. during the 3 weeks of our first breakup, they were texting as “friends” and he went on tinder, which i get. he came back to me and said he wanted to try again and change for me and i said okay. he unfollowed the sorority girl and any other girl he met on tinder while we broke up, still stating he just wanting to make friends and try to forget me but couldn’t bc “they weren’t like me”.

the year and a half was super great, we became even way closer and spent SO much time together. he was my literal rock. but however, we did have rough times on my end where I’d be “hard to please” and where he would be “inconsistent with what i wanted from him (surprise dates, flowers, reassurance). a few times when we brought up  the idea to end things, he always said “ no, all couples go through a rough time and it’s just a rough patch. No matter who you’re with there will be issues but even if we did i know we’d get back together again in the future because i love you no matter what”z 

it became really hard. we started arguing a few months ago a lot, getting mad at eachother and it was us against eachother sadly. he would always say “you have an attitude and i can never please you. But i won’t ever leave you because i believe in you and us” and i promised i would change, i did , a little but i fell into a hole again and we started arguing a lot. he became inconsistent, and i hated that. the little things bothered me. The last three weeks, we’ve gotten in arguments where I’ve never seen him yell as much as he did, he kicked me out his house when we were gonna have a sleepover and snatched my phone out my hand. we were going to the gym and got in an argument and i wanted to go home and i walked out the car at a red light. we called eachother names, and i would try to suggest things and he would be like “ you’re dumb as fuck, that makes no sense you’re a smart girl but you always say stupid shit” and he tried to grab my shirt when i walked out the car. that day, he broke up with me. He started being less patient I’ve noticed, and getting irritated a lot more. He was loyal, never made me feel insecure. He helped wipe my tears.

i was pleading with him. he said no, i never saw him that serious and it was scary. he promised me so much, and always said all couples go through this and he wouldn’t wanna do it with anyone else. this time,i said to him i didn’t wanna lose him and see him with anyone else bc it would hurt and he said he promised me i wouldn’t , and that never say never to us not getting back in the future . he also said this isn’t the end of us because nothing is the end. i told him I’d change for him and how i was always by his side when he changed and he said i know but I’ve given you too many chances , and that this time he’s done with us for now, but not forever . He said I’m his soulmate and he believes we’re meant to be, but right now we need to focus on ourselves. It hurt, but i understood. I told him i wanna be with him in the future and he said “ i do too, but we need to go with time because we don’t know what the future has in store “ which it hurt me bc before he used ti be optimistic about us and the future, and he did he isn’t the same person as he was before when he said these things. 

We ended up going our own ways and i texted him two days later asking for him to rethink his decision and if he really wanted to throw 2 years away, and he said “this is my stance on the situation and i know you’re more than willing to wait and change but i can’t right now with us. We’re done and there’s no more us. I want to move on and I’m not telling you to lose hope but this is my stance.” It fucking hurt. All those words he said and 2 days ago he was more promising , what changed in 2 days? . I blocked him, and he blocked me.

However, he followed both of his ex’s on Instagram again and tiktok, and he would talk SO MUCH SHIT about him! They are  the ones who used him for his “body” and the other one who he broke up w bc of her issues. He also started following the sorority girl i mentioned earlier on the story again, and re downloaded dating apps and started following more and more girls ( i lurked from another account, not good).

I’m really hurt. He was there for me, vise versa. He came with me to doctors appointments, helped me realize my worth and i didn’t need anyone , but i was so dependent on him. I asked him if this was okay during our relationship and he said “ ofc, we’re partners. I got you for life my baby. I’m not going anywhere. No matter if we argue or yell or laugh, i wouldn’t wanna do it with anyone else”. He also texted my grandma a few months ago saying no matter what i do and say, he’ll always love me.

I’m scared. Scared i won’t find another love like him, won’t build that super strong bond with anyone else ever again, and it’s scary. He said he wants to move on but he goes to his ex’s he talked about, and a bunch of other girls. We’re at the same college but it’s so weird. Should i have hope? Idk if he’ll come back. But he said we were soulmates and meant to be. He said he’ll always be with me but he blocked me. Any advice? I’m only 20 ik, but what if that was my only soulmate ever? . We were so close i can’t stress that enough like he was the guy version of me.

I’m going to going to therapy soon. 

TL;DR: my ex broke up with me for the second time because he was done with me. he went back to follow all his ex’s and old females he talked to.

relationship_advice,"First off, sorry if this is long. If been in a relationship for 6yrs now. 3yrs in, Covid took a devastating hit on our relationship but I thought we were strong enough to get past it.

I met him on Tinder, during a 4yr single spell. I felt lonely and as someone who didn't put themselves out there, I decided to. He msgd me, but as a catfish, except I didn't know that until we met up. We had been talking for a little bit so I felt ok. Somehow the relationship hit, and yes it started out of desperation on both iur ends but it actually turned into soemthing. Now I was still going to university while they were working from 2pm-10pm. We hung out constantly but he never wanted to do anything that may be considered pricey. I totally understood that as I was juggling a full course load while starting a side business to pay for my extra expense. I dont judge peoples financial situation as I understand the complexity of peoples circumstances and the government. He used to randomly buy me flowers or sporadically cooked. But then his job really messed him up, he was already not taking care of himself health wise but now they cut back his pay and due to others quitting, led to him taking on the bulk of the work. This led to nights ending at 11:30pm and complaints of how nothings open to eat. With conversations of why im always tired to talk or hear about wat happened at work. Hanging out then became a constant, i go over to his place and sit on his couch doing school or business stuff, and he put on a show we like and then play games with his discord friends, i fall asleep and then we cuddle. The sex became extremely unattractive due to my OCD of germs (bilogy student) and their lack of brushing their teeth of taking care of their appearance, ay least thry showered daily, right? After Covid, now 3yrs I see this going nowhere. I'm about to graduate and struggled to get here, meanwhile he's been complaining about the government and how Covid vaccines were a scam because of new studies. As someone taking biology and chemistry I have read these articles, but this post is not about any of that. My point with that was because it was all he kept messaging me and talking to me about for 3yrs. I asked what they were gonna do about it as they don't vote and have no political knowledge or power, yet act like they are better than everyone else while having nothing himself. This person throws stuff out bc he never thinks he'll have a use for it, and when he finally got his own place I though he's going to mature. Well not only can he not afford his own place, he has no savings, is still complaining, and doesn't know what he wants. 
(This seems really long, sorry, I just have no one else to talk to about this)

To cut it short, the other day I talked to his mum, we were supposed to travel but it turns out he may not be able to anymore. They want me to wait a year and want to talk him into counseling, but like I dont care. I love him as a person but the love in our relationship has been replaced with ""i knew this would happen, government this, did u read this article I sent you""  no good mornings, no 3-5 year plan and I've asked multiple times during our relationship. There's too much comfortability with being gross.

I'm graduating, just bought a house full out, I'm starting.thisnpart of my life later then everyone else I know and grew up with or helped raise. Friends are getting married, my family's growing with  new babies, and everyone else seems so happy (in REAL life, not social media) and its not fair. 
He and his folks want me to wait with him for a year while he get his past situation handled. I told them all that it's not fair, it should've been worked on long before it you thought his was real and believed in ur kid. He needs therapy and literally said he doesn't want ""meds shoved down his throat, just someone to talk to"" and I explained that that's not therapy, and im not a therapist. I have my own life to figure out.

My question is, during this year, after I move, do I just cut this person off or keep a line open in the hopes they may actually use this time to better themselves. I  am NOT bringing that negativity and helplessness into my new space, but I don't want to abandon him. He's just had so much negative stuff happen that he can't see the positives. 

TLDR: Been in a relationship for 6yrs. Covid his 3yrs in, removed ALL the romance and fun. Boyfriend complains about the government making it hard for him but doesn't take opportunities that would benefit him. I'm graduating, bought a house, funancially stabld, and moving.

relationship_advice,"
Okay so quick background I (22F) met this guy (18M) last week outside of Walgreens. He’s a flamboyant bisexual guy and he complimented me on my hair and we talked and exchanged contact. We ended up hanging out that day, we went bike riding then back to my place to smoke and eat. 

Within the day we met I notice a few things that sort of were red flags. Also him being 18 was already off putting to me but my best friend is two years younger than me and she’s very mature and we bond very well and her age has never been a problem so I overlooked his age. Not to say that because I’m 22 I’m this super mature person lol but I do feel that certain childish behavior and tendencies I no longer possess.

First, like I said before when we met it was because he complimented me. Him and I were at the Walgreens together and he complimented a few other people in the same manner he did with me. After the first time he did it again, it felt very phony and like he was one of those ppl who just excessively compliments people and doesn’t actually mean it. I think this is weird and off putting. Throughout the day he continued to compliment me, saying how pretty I was, how nice I am, how beautiful my laugh is, just so many compliments. In the moment it felt a bit meh but I didn’t think too much of it. 

Second, one the first day that we meet he over shared QUITE a bit and that was quite off putting to me. He told me that he had been molested as a child, that his dad molested his niece and that his dad is now dead. He was telling me how much he hates his dad and how much he looks like his dad. All of this was a bit much too me. When I was in a phase where I was extremely lonely I often found myself oversharing with friends and since realizing that this doesn’t create the closeness and vulnerability that I desire I have stopped and have become more private and reserved and I don’t feel the need to open up with strangers. 

Third, 60% of the time when we were hanging out he was talking about boys. Showing me pictures of a bunch of guys asking me if I thought they were cute which I did not and that honestly was really annoying. 

Fourth, last night he text me asking if he could come over and stay with me for the night because he and his mom got in huge fight and she scratched him (he sent me a pic of a little cut on what I assume was his stomach) although I understood that he was in a difficult situation, I did not feel comfortable with him coming over and I honestly did not have the capacity or desire to deal with that so I told him that I’m really sorry about the situation and that I’m out with a friend so he cannot. He said okay and that he understood and that he would text me later to let me know that he was safe. 

To me he just seems like a source of drama that I don’t need or want in my life. I have been looking for new friends I express that to him when I first met that I’m down to hang with ppl and that I’m normally free (I regret this lol) 


Also on the day we met he was telling me about this other girl he met at school that he had became friends with and that he was upset that she had basically ghosted him. He ended up texting her to ask her what was up and she responded with a paragraph saying how she doesn’t have the time for him. She said that he was always trying to hang out and that she had to manage her time between all her friends and she doesn’t have the time for him. In the moment I didn’t yet understand what she meant but now I know. He’s text me quite a few times about nothing really asking how my day is and wyd which I didn’t really mind. Then he’s been asking me to ft and I said no and explained to him that I don’t like being on the phone. Feels a bit suffocating especially since this person is still a stranger. 

He text me a little while ago asking if I was free to hang out. I honestly don’t want the friendship to go any further. My friend told me not to reply and to text him later saying that I wasn’t near my phone. And to continue to text back really late when he text and not engage. I decided not to text back like she said but I feel like I just want to be straightforward about not wanting to be friends. I’m not sure how I can express my concerns without being mean or hurtful towards him. How should I say it?

So I’ve (22f) been seeing this guy (25m) for about a month now. We connect really well and I love spending time with him. We spend hours talking and cuddling and it’s great. He loves physical touch and loves kissing specifically making out. Unfortunately, I do not like kissing. It just doesn’t do anything for me due to the lack of stimulation. I’ve kissed over 10 ppl in my life and only had one kiss that I loved, I was at a party, drunk af and I made out with girl. I literally felt sparks and it felt so good touching her body and her touching mine. I am queer so I don’t have any confusions about my attraction to women. I kissed another girl at a party drunk and felt nothing and actually really disliked the kiss. 

Anyways, since the day we met I told him about how I don’t like kissing and he had no issues with this and was pretty understanding. Everytime we kiss he ask me if it feels okay and if I’m comfortable which I really appreciate and it makes me want to enjoy making out more because I know how pleasurable it is for him. The last time we hung out, I told him I wanted us to practice kissing each other so I can feel more comfortable and so we can find our rhythm. We made out 75% of the time while we hung out and although I didn’t not like it, I still didn’t enjoy it as much as I would’ve hoped. I don’t mind a few smooches but the making out is too much for me. The only time I love making out is when I’m having sex, lips feel so soft and I love kissing there’s a passion in it then for me and I’m assuming because of all the other stimulation. 

I love when he kissing my forehead, my cheek and when we Eskimo kiss. I feel so much intimacy and affection in these kisses and these are the sort of kisses I love. I love kissing him on the cheek and neck but making out just doesn’t do it for me without the extra stimulation. I want to talk to him about this again because I really do want to be able to give him that because I know how much he enjoys it but I don’t want him to feel pressured to  rub pu$y and body every time we make out. How should I approach the convo? And does anyone have any tips about how I can navigate this?",t2_9ab2jobt,0,I (22f) don’t like making out and (25m) I’m seeing loves it,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wm6qa,True,Plane_Abies_4962,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wm6qa/i_22f_dont_like_making_out_and_25m_im_seeing/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wm6qa/i_22f_dont_like_making_out_and_25m_im_seeing/,8848458,1682276481,0,,False,1682276497,1682276497,2023-04-23 19:01:21,,,

relationship_advice,"
My(23M) Boyfriend (25M), was receiving quite a lot of text from a dude who followed him on Ig.
This guy kept asking him to send him nudes and other nsfw material and my boyfriend kept responding no to him.
I told him not to block this guy because we were both having fun laughing at the way he was insisting and at certain text.
Until yesterday when my boyfriend feeling bad for this dude, gave him his old Twitter account where he used to post nsfw material(covering his face) during the quarantine.
I knew the existence of this profile and it didn’t bother me a first, since he was no longer using it and was followed by a couple of people from other countries.
He told me about this laughing and thinking there was nothing wrong about it.
I told him that this thing hurted my feelings and made me feel cheated on.
He apologized and proceeded to block him. 
I really love him and other than this our relationship is great, I’m not mad, just really disappointed.

relationship_advice,"I am part of a social group of a big set of friends around a hobby. I am currently not very well but getting by - I have numerous tumours that I am waiting treatment for. I was due to do something with the group last week but was struggling. I told this friend, and also why I might not make it, and he was quite rude about it to begin with. When the day came I tried to go - it involved several hours travel. I completed the travel but I couldn't make the event because I was too sick. He was really really offensive to both me and my wife about it, aggressive and angry, sending rude messages and insults.

Honestly it really threw me. It seemed a massive overreaction. He didn't care how I was. There were many more friends also attending. I haven't spoken to him since. We are friends in a group rather than individually. He keeps sending me angry messages about other things which I know are just attempts to be in touch such as being angry with me that I haven't turned up for our shared hobby which has no impact on him taking part at all. He isn't a level of friend where I feel I need to even explain why I am not engaging, because I have no interest in being friends anymore. As far as I am concerned he acted completely terribly and I never want to engage again. I would rather not engage with any of that friendship group again than have to see him. I feel a bit stupid because I feel scared of him.

If I wasn't scared of his reaction I would tell him to just leave me alone and I don't want to be in contact. I am not someone who avoids confrontation or having difficult conversations usually. I don't really know how to resolve this without just walking away to protect myself. A friend I know through the group has got in touch today to ask how I am.

relationship_advice,"Hi all, 

I’ve been scrolling on this app and this sub for awhile now and I’ve read plenty of stories regarding troublesome age gaps. I’ve began to wonder if my age difference with my husband is problematic.

I (28F) met my husband (34M) as children, (family friends, not very close) but we didn’t notice each other until we were adults. We reconnected over social media shortly after my 20th birthday. He had his 26th birthday a few days prior to our first date. 

We clicked really easily and he did state quite often that I was mature for my age. We got married after my 25th birthday and now have a young child together. 

I don’t want to leave him, I guess just looking for insight. The more I read these stories regarding age gaps, the more I can see similarities to my own life.",t2_i8qnhvla,0,Age gap troublesome? 20F / 26M,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wlvbd,True,Colegirl6,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wlvbd/age_gap_troublesome_20f_26m/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wlvbd/age_gap_troublesome_20f_26m/,8848395,1682275900,0,,False,1682275915,1682275915,2023-04-23 18:51:40,,,

relationship_advice,"I(27F)have been getting to know a (29M)Scorpio man for 2 weeks now. He texts good morning every morning and we text throughout the day. Our interactions are very sweet, funny, emotional. We both expressed that we could see ourselves being together in a relationship. (we have met in person twice and it was good) We were supposed to be going on a date this Friday, but it got too late and I told him could we do lunch tomorrow instead. He didn't reply so an hour later I called him. He didn't answer and texts and says he's talking to his buddy. Then I send him a text saying I'm tired of him waiting until the last minute to plan things with me (because this isn't the first time he's done that, more like the third) and I sent him maybe 5 texts. He didn't answer any. This was Friday night. So then Saturday he didn't text his usual good morning, he didn't text at all. I sent him a long text that he didn't respond to. I don't have much experience with Scorpios, so I'm wondering, do you think he will come back? Am I being ghosted? Or is he upset because I sent so many texts in a row?

Hello. 
My boyfriend wants me to delete all guys on my social media. I love him so much. At first i said we will see about that. Then he became too obsessed with it.
I dont add guys on it since i started dating him. I dont text any guys. I just follow some from old school. To stay in touch. Recently he asked for it again. And my answer was straight ""no, im not this type of girls who only have girls on their socials i dont care about ppl's gender. Some share infos i need. Some are from highschool"" He answered that im choosing random guys over him. 
I really love him so much. And it broke my heart to hear he is making me choose between this and him 
None of these guys was my ex nor showed romantic interest in me. They dont post provoking pics.
We broke up over it and my heart is broken. I tried to talk to him many times. Every time it ended with "" me or them? "" 
Altho I don't really care about these guys. Just
its a way to stay in touch with the world.

relationship_advice,"Hi, so me and my gf have been together for almost 5 years now (ik that sounds insane to a lot of you probably). I genuinely see a future with her. But as of right now, well over the past couple of months we've been in this super rough patch. We both go to universities with completely different campus cultures. My university is a work hard play hard type of environment, very competitive, but also fun and rewarding when you aren't stressing about a paper or tests upcoming. Her school is definitely one of the more party hard types of schools. Recently, she has been hanging out with some people who have definitely changed her personality a considerable amount (a few of my other friends asked about it), but i figured it just her finding herself. Freshman year is difficult (it was rough for me too, and right now I'm writing this reddit post instead of studying for finals).

Anyways, recently we had to have a conversation because she said some things that came off as very mean (i asked her if she wanted to go to a concert with me and it kinda went downhill from there, long story short she didn't want to go because she only knew a few songs, but last summer i did that same thing for her and her favorite artist only knowing 2 songs). Anyways after we talked, she was upset, which is 110% valid and this isn't the first time we've had a conversation about things like this, we've had two other conversations and they were fairly productive. Most of her habits changed (except substance use which got better briefly but now... I think it's worse than where we started and i don't want to keep bring up the same shit like a plunger you know?) Also very important to note, during this conversation, i talked about how i felt like she treated me different while she was at school than when we're at home.

The past week has been considerably worse. The day after the conversation, she was texting me like everything was fine, then i asked how her day was and she said that her friends were helping her feel better. And i was like okay, and i apologized again for any stress and pain that i had caused her in bring up the things that were bothering me. The next day, i tried to give her some space and i just checked in with one of her friends (her friend then told her which was totally fine), so then she messaged me that she was okay and a thank you for giving her space and then she asked me to elaborate on what i meant but the conversation we had so i did elaborate on how it felt like i was being treated not as great. 

We've continued to be in this weird state, and yesterday i was feeling absolutely terrible and I'm always the one who initiates conversations now (it wasn't like that before it was definitely more 50/50), but she didn't text me for the entire day (over 26 hours, which may not feel like a lot, but for people who text everyday, even 12 hours without a text is concerning). When i texted her this morning, she finally responded and was just giving me the shortest one word responses ever.

I'm trying to give the benefit of the doubt here and maybe it's just a temporary rough patch, but it hasn't been the best over the past few months and ATP I'm at a loss. I truly love this woman and we've even talked about marriage and started planning futures together...",t2_7kwt5a3p,0,I (19F) feel like I'm putting in all the effort into my relationship with my gf (18F),[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wlm90,True,Junior_Drag_3128,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wlm90/i_19f_feel_like_im_putting_in_all_the_effort_into/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wlm90/i_19f_feel_like_im_putting_in_all_the_effort_into/,8848343,1682275434,0,,False,1682275454,1682275455,2023-04-23 18:43:54,,,
relationship_advice,"I (25F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been together for a year (our anniversary is in 2 weeks), he is the best thing that happened to me in a while, he is understanding, nice, considerate, cares about me, try his best to learn how to be a better boyfriend every day, good in bed (really good!), supports me through my mental health journey, patient with me, treats me well, he got clean of drugs a month into our relationship because as he said ""you gave me a reason to be a better person"" and in general a really good boyfriend. 
The issue is summed up in two main things: first, he is a different nationality (his mother is from my country but his father is from a neighboring country), which means it's near impossible for me to marry him because of cultural and legal reasons, obviously I'm not from the US and English is not my first language so please excuse me. His mother was born and raised in that country and he was born and raised in my country, but it is really really difficult to marry him unless I run away and cut my family completely which is a really hard decision to make since I'm really close to my family and I have a good community here, and we both knew this from the beginning but continued with the relationship regardless because we really liked each other a lot. I'm starting to really think about my future family and I want to have children as soon as possible because of some health issues I have. 
The second reason is that he lies a lot! Small lies that won't affect anything but he is actually a really good liar and covers his tracks very well, I managed to catch him sometimes and confront him, sometimes he denies it and sometimes he confuses fast. For example, one time I was in the ER and my mother was with me so I told him not to come because I didn't wanna deal with the interaction between him and mother since my family doesn't know him very well and don't know the extent of our relationship, he told me he was in the parking waiting for me but when I checked his location he was actually at home, I texted him a picture of his location and he turned of his phone for 20 minutes, exactly the time that would take him to drive to the same ER I was in, and he had some excuse that his phone died and maybe the location didn't update yet since he had bad service, I let it slide for that time but confronted him a couple days later and he denied it but I cornered him and he confessed after I told him if he continues to lie to me about stupid stuff I will assume he is lying about big stuff too ! I absolutely despise lying and will not tolerate it and I expressed that several times to him but he still does it. I feel I can't trust him 100%. 
I thought he was the perfect person for me, because I had a bad experience with a toxic relationship that lasted 5 years before, so I'm not sure if he is actually that good of a person or is my standards low? 
I need some insight, I don't have a good reference for a healthy relationship in my life and I feel he filled a void inside me. I was single for more than a year before I met him and I'm not ready to be single again, I'm emotionally attached to him and I love him deeply , but I have this gut feeling that it's bad for both of us to continue this relationship and I can't see a future for this. 
Any advice is appreciated but please be nice.

relationship_advice,"My (m33) ex (f28) is driving me to madness

I am losing it now

Long story short, me and my ex have a toxic relationship. Crazy about each other but she will never commit. But she always will reach out then will start an argument. 

Most recently she messaged me via email(she blocked me everywhere else) saying I was the only one that truly loved and cared for her and she wanted to thank me.  Said she was having a really rough mental health day. Then asked if I didn’t want her to reach out anymore. This turned into me asking to hang because I lost a friend this week to OD and it’s been tough. 

She was just staying in and today I text asking if wants to go for a hike or something and she said “look I wasn’t trying to lead you on sorry”. Then I asked her to please not contact me if she wasn’t interested in working on things. This made her angry and I tried my very best not to give a reaction. I tried so hard. And in the end, she got her reaction. I overdid it. I got weak again and I’ve been trying so hard to get over her and move on. She says that she’s not interested and to move on then keeps coming and doing that. Blaming me for not being able to even send a nice message. 

I don’t know what to do anymore I thought I was going to marrry this girl I still freaking love her but she is ruining me. And making me feel like I’m so weak. I sent her another “final” message letting her know I did start talking to someone but also was weak and said she’s not you though. 

Im in therapy. On meds. I workout 6 days a week. This girl is going to be the damn reason I hurt myself again I swear. Back in November she broke up with me and then 3 days later I lost my job. I ended up very broken and did some dumb things to myself. We can’t have a normal conversation. Why can’t she just have a conversation and not argue or block me?  She always gets angry at me instead of just talking to me. 

Any words of encouragement would help

relationship_advice,"Is it ""normal"" to feel this way 6+ months into a relationship? We met on Hinge in June 2022 and made things official in August after going on many dates.

That said, as in every relationship, things started well, and then he began bringing me into his inner circle ( parents, friends etc.); that is when I started to see and experience things, which has made me rethink my relationship and overall commitment. 

&amp;#x200B;

First, we are an interracial couple; he was adopted, from Romania, so the first thing I noticed was that his parents, who are in their mid-70s, were not too welcoming toward me; they were very cold, which made my boyfriend a bit angry. Still, he constantly tries to reassure me that they like me, but I feel otherwise; they are Catholic, and I'm not committed to a religious denomination, so I assume that also plays a part.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, He had to break up a friendship with one of his long-time girl friends in his circle as she was going through a bunch of drama and threatened to kill herself if he didn't kiss her one evening, so he allowed her to kiss him on both cheeks and after telling me this two months later, I told him he crossed a boundary and that I didn't know if I could trust him moving forward, he apologized and said he understood.

&amp;#x200B;

My third issue is that my boyfriend was raised extremely cuddled and sheltered, and he told me this, which has also impacted our connection, as I'm very open and have more lived experiences than him; we have planned our first trip together for July, and we are heading to August, this will be his second time travelling in his life, as his parents did not allow him to travel due to his brother who is developmentally challenged. After his father found out he was heading to Vegas, he was furious at my boyfriend and me.

&amp;#x200B;

He also mentioned that it has challenges  ( Fetal Alcohol Exposure). His brother would have to live with him or right next door in the future when his parents pass away, as he is under guardianship for life, my boyfriend has expressed a bit of anger/sadness at having to care for his brother and potentially having a family of his own, anyhow I know this bothers him. Still, I'm thinking long-term, how would this impact my relationship?

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue is communication, he doesn't enjoy texting or calling me in between our sleepovers and dates, so honestly I feel no connection in between a week or 2 we are not together and I have expressed this to him and not much has changed, even though he is on instagram at times, but doesn't send me a text or anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last issue is sex; we have not successfully had sex since the beginning of our experimentation in November 2022; my boyfriend gets discouraged when things don't work out regarding positions and so forth, and he tells me he is too tired to try anything for the last few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend told me I could express to him any issue I have in our relationship, but these are significant issues and differences, so I'm unsure how to proceed.

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years and been living together for almost 2 years. We’ve been going through some issues lately. One major problem being that he is not happy with the level of intimacy in our relationship. I have two reproductive disorders (PCOS and endometriosis) that result in me having a lower libido and not making sex a major priority in my life. 
However, I’m not a prude. In our years of dating, I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve said no to him propositioning me for sex. 
The issue is he no longer propositions me and expects me to carry the weight of our intimate relationship. He often makes me feel bad for not having a higher libido than I do and tells me he has never had these relationship problems before with other women. This really hurts me. I’m doing what I can to balance my hormones, but certain things are beyond my control. 
To get into the title of it all, my boyfriend gets upset with me in the mornings on random days because I didn’t snuggle him before getting out of bed. These mornings I wake up to go to the restroom. I was my face and brush my teeth while I’m there. Once I am up….my dog is up and wants to go out. So I take him out to the bathroom. At this point I am awake, so I move on with my morning (making coffee, listening to podcasts, my morning routine) …while my boyfriend continues to snooze. Once he wakes up, he’s often upset with me because I didn’t stay in bed to either snuggle or get intimate. However, he doesn’t ask me to return to bed because he’d like snuggles….which would be a healthy way to communicate. He instead will ask me if he smells or if I’m “in a bad mood.” He has told me many times that he wishes I would just know or pick up on his hints that he wants that intimacy. 

I don’t understand if I’m supposed to just lay in bed until he wakes up or get back into bed every day….just in case he wants to snuggle. I don’t think I’m asking for much when I ask him to just communicate these wants with me…because I’m happy to oblige. But I’m not a mind reader and I don’t live to serve him/his needs. 

Also for reference, I bought him candles for Christmas with funny sexual names that he can light to let me know he’s in the mood. He hasn’t used them once. I am also taking supplements to try to raise my libido. We are also in counseling but just getting started.  

To me this feels like he’s so afraid of rejection from me for some reason that he is afraid to initiate intimacy. However, it doesn’t feel fair that our lackluster sex life is then blamed completely on me.

relationship_advice,"I’m really struggling with keeping to no contact. For the first couple of weeks, I texted her all the usual stuff, we can do this, we can fix this, we can work this out, I love you, suggested every solution I could possibly think of.

She has an incredibly stressful job in healthcare, and there have been various communication issues in the relationship  recently due to high stress situations all in a short time period (multiple Bereavements, etc) 

We are compatible in many ways, and I am willing to work together and even go to couples therapy with her, and I’ve suggested reading through communication, styles, books and videos with her to learn and grow together.

On a particularly stressful day three weeks ago, we had plans for dinner and she received a stressful phone call just beforehand from a family member, she just said is “I can’t do this, and I need a break to heal.” “I love you with all my heart but I need to find myself again and need space.”

I’m really struggling with it, it was her birthday yesterday, and I said nothing to try to respect her space and it really hurts. 

I’m struggling with feelings of anxiety and sadness that she will lose feelings throughout this period and think that everything is too hard. 

Her family is religious and don’t approve of her dating and have expressed disapproval in her being in a relationship with me, which has added extra pressure on the relationship too.

I know the best thing is to just work on myself and leave her be, but it’s so damn hard. She has blocked me on everything except text.

I’ve set a 30 day timer on my phone screen as a start .

The way she left it with me, was that she loved me, she was going to be absolutely loyal to me throughout the space, but that she didn’t know what would happen after that, and she will decide the next steps then . 
She’s apparently on a waiting list for therapy, which can take quite some time in my country .

She stated various factors that she was unhappy with between us before she broke off with me, mostly around times one communication has broken down (recently) 

I’m willing to work and put all my effort into learning and growing with her.

I know, she loves me very deeply, so there is no risk of her moving on very quickly, and I trust that it’s not because there’s somebody else involved. I want the best for her, but I also don’t want to lose her and us in the process.

TL;DR! My girlfriend has asked for a break to work on her mental health, and I’m really struggling with no contact, and I’m worried she will lose feelings and it will end up in more than a break and a full break up. I know, she loves me very deeply, so there is no risk of her moving on very quickly, and I trust that it’s not because there’s somebody else involved.

relationship_advice,"she lives 1000km from me. She dosen´t know how I look. We used to text each other every day, snapchat each other every day, and tell us everything. 1 year ago we started calling each other, and the first time we spend hours and hours of talking on the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

The last time she wrote me ""I really like you"" was August 2022. After that, nothing really happend..

&amp;#x200B;

* She stopped writing me. She replys in short written answers. She takes hours or days to reply. I see her online in WhatsApp, going offline and not answering me.
* She stopped Snapchating with me and let a streak of 1400 days (where we send each other pictures) fade away recently. She says she stopped keeping streaks, but I looked at her snapchat points which are still increasing. Shes lying.
* The last 8 phone calls she either didnt pick up or she told me ""can we talk later? in 30 minutes?"" and guess what: she didnt call or wrote me the next day ""omg sorry I forgot/fell asleep""
* Last year we send us presents on christmas. I send mine. She didnt. She told me month after months shes going to, but she still didnt do it.

&amp;#x200B;

2 Months ago we had a phone call were I told her:

""Hey if I did something wrong tell me.

\&gt;No you didnt do anything wrong, I´ve just been busy lately.""

To the fact that she ignored me on WhatsApp she said ""I didnt see your message - lets not talk about it your giving me bad vibes""

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? How should I act? My friend A told me:

""Call her one more time and if she says no/can you phone later? you say no. Just make her feel that you have enough and that you don´t do this bullshit no more.""

&amp;#x200B;

My other friend said:

""Just leave her alone. Youll be needy. She is propably gonna contact you again, but stay strong.. just think about what she does to you right now. What kind of friend is this?""

relationship_advice,"Probably sounds super dumb but I am the very affectionate type and when I say this I don’t want it to sound like my bf isn’t Bcs he can be but only at night for about an hour or two max out of the whole 24hrs of the day. I always ask for a quick 2 second hug when I’m passing him in the apt or walk in from work (I work full time and go to the gym for lengthy workings so I’m gone all day pretty much) and when I walk in I’m always super excited to see him and I’ll run up to him and try to hug me and he always makes a disgusted face at me or an “oh god” face and push me away before I can even wrap my arms around him or he will hold me arms lengths away so I can’t even touch him then he will make a remark of “Jesus I’m already annoyed” and then I get upset and sad and walk away then he can’t figure out why I’m upset and says I have a negative attitude right after I just got put down by him trying to give him a 2 second hug, you’d think partners would be happy to see eachother after a long day right and become eachothers peace and talk about the day for a quick second like how was your day? Instead I get called names and get remarks. Hugs only take two seconds and why should I contain my happiness happiness is beautiful..especially feeling that much seeing him after a stressful day. I’m in the military and work in health care it’s a lot. Still he always makes me feel like a little insignificant dumbass and I’ll complain about it then he will say that he’s busy, too busy for a 2 second hug MAX? I feel like pushing me away and complaining at my face takes longer than the hug I was coming in for. He affects my self esteem in these little ways significantly in our relationship. He never works on his own self improvement between us too only I do I’ve destroyed so mad OLD bad habits while he’s on same thing and says ppl can’t change overnight. It’s been like a year or two I think that’s enough for atleast one thing to slightly change in the right direction. Trying not to call me a name and make me feel like I have 0 common sense ever and don’t know what 2+2 is isn’t that hard. I act GOOFY sure. But I’m not stupid. Why is it so hard to show me a second of affection and not make me feel this way? I must not be important enough? What am I always fighting for here.

relationship_advice,"Like the title says, my (f20) boyfriend (m31) has lied to me about a lot and his age is one of those things. I am currently doing my second year of a law degree and I met him on campus, we are in the same year group. At first I assumed he was around my age as he looks really young. On our first date he tells me that he is 26, which is not a big gap. 

After we slept together for the first time I find out that he is actually married. In my country there is a difference between a valid legal marriage and an invalid marriage. His was invalid so he never needed to get an official divorce. After finding this out I assumed that was the biggest problem and that we could work through it. 

After this hurdle I find his identity card. Looking at the dates it was very easy to realise that he is actually not that age that he says he is. Eventually I got him to confess to me his true age and while I thought it would make me feel better it really doesn’t. Honestly I just don’t know what to do or how to leave the relationship.

relationship_advice,"My sister and I are super close. We have the same friends, we travel together twice a year and basically do everything together. She now has a new boyfriend and they've been dating for 5 months. They're always texting always hanging out together and I understand that, but, even when she's hanging out with me, she's texting him and isn't present at all. We stopped having the fun conversations we used to have and long story short we became distant. I am trying to understand as much as possible but her boyfriend doesn't seem to understand boundaries and I think she's allowing it. He automatically invites himself when we are spending time alone. Ever since they started dating, my sister and I haven't been to any of our special outings without him. And all the special events we're planning to go to this year he has bought tickets for already to tag along. To get to the point, we were planning a girls trip with friends this May and another trip (me and my sister alone) in November. I did tell my sister that it's okay if she wants to bring him along in November. Mind you, it was all planned before she met him. However, due to visa restrictions, my sister and I can't go to the May trip anymore (which we are so sad about) and had to change the plan to another country and the girls trip is now postponed to November. We agreed that we'll see how things go in November and take it from there. We already booked our new May destination and I planned the whole thing and I was really excited to finally spend time with my sister alone and bond. And to add, we both have been so stressed out for the past few months and really need this trip. But all of a sudden today her bf asked her if he could join us as we might go on a girls trip in November instead. My sister and I argued a lot and I felt that now after working so hard and planning this, I have to 3rd wheel.. She told me I should understand as ""I was the one who suggested that he comes in November's trip"" and that she's in a bad position and can't reject his request. She said to choose if he should tag along in May or Nov. Eventually I told her May which is literally in 2 weeks!! I am so upset and disappointed and I feel that she chose him over me. I asked her when does she want him to join and she said May too as she'd rather for us to have our time alone in November. I know I did tell her he can join in November, but now due to what happened to our visa the plans have changed and I think it's okay to explain to him that and maybe next year they can plan a trip as couple together alone. I feel like I am suffocating, he invites himself and assumes that I am always okay with him being around. I've only seen him 3 times and doesn't seem to have friends of his own thus doesn't truly understand the concept of privacy and space. I was really looking forward to this trip and now honestly I don't want to go at all.. as a third wheel or as a solo traveler in such a short notice! I didn't even prepare for it mentally! Please tell me if I am exaggerating and if I should be more understanding. I can't help but feel so upset and disappointed about it. How can I get through this trip? I really miss my sister and for 6 months now we haven't actually had anytime alone where she was fully present.

relationship_advice,"Long so TL;DR at the bottom. 

I have been dating my boyfriend for about a month and a half now (officially a little over a month), and prior to that, I was helping him with his relationship problems. His ex dumped him almost a year ago now but they still talked everyday or at least very often from what I recall. 

One of the first instances of me helping him was when he broke down at the news of his ex talking to someone she used to date(?) before and he was thinking to himself, “why couldn’t it be me?” The second instance, and we were already getting serious with each other and she knew of me, she informed him that she was going to get married to one of her exes as a dying with of that ex’s relative and I held him as he cried but I also started revealing my distaste for her because I was left to deal with the aftermath. The third instance was when we were on a dinner date and he excused himself to go to the bathroom and when he came back, it was obvious that he was crying and it was because she told him that they shouldn’t talk for a while because she doesn’t want to infringe our relationship and that she loves him; he replied that he loves her too. By this point, I had no grace for her and I definitely started to resent her. What made it worse was that she bought him a sentimental gift that she talked about getting him while they were still in a relationship and it came in a few days later.

A few days ago, she messaged him, drunk, saying that she got married recently even though it was originally scheduled for June and wanted to catch up. He kept the conversation short after me telling him how I felt about the whole situation. She messaged him again yesterday but he didn’t open it until an hour ago and it was a screen shot of something that he liked and thought was funny. At this point, I just blew up and told him how this whole ordeal made me feel—that this whole push and pull type of situation is not only toxic for him, but it made me even more upset because to me it feels like she’s just coming and going as she pleases with him. I straight up asked him if he still wants her in her life and he replied, “as a friend.” He claims he doesn’t have anymore romantic feelings towards her and that they would never be as close as they used to, but he likes her as a friend.

My boyfriend is a really nice guy and tries his best to not upset others by putting them before himself and because of that, I have grown to be protective of him. I also have childhood trauma of feelings of abandonment and that I am not good enough and that I tend to self-sabotage my relationships when my sense of security feels threatened; I also stressed the fact that although this is my trauma, it is not something to burden him by, but only for him to know and understand where I’m coming from. 

During this morning’s conversation, I told him about how much I feel threatened by his ex and although I would much rather he not talk to her anymore, I would want it to be because he wants to and not on my behalf. I told him that although it is possible for people to remain friends with their exes, I personally don't do it and am not emotionally mature enough to handle this, especially after witnessing the handful amount of times he's cried over her. I told him that I am now self-sabotaging by emotionally pushing him away because I have been hurt and disappointed too many times and that I need to protect my own heart.

I have requested for space for the time being to reflect and simply because I want to be alone, but I do want to get an outsider’s perspective on this situation. He told me that my feelings are valid but I can’t help but feel that I am being a possessive girlfriend.

TL;DR my boyfriend and his ex still kept in contact after she dumped him and and he wants her as a friend even though she's hurt him countless times and is aware of my distaste for this situation.",t2_2bul9652,0,In need of an outsider's perspective/advice on my(26F) and my boyfriend's(22M) relationship.,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wkkyq,True,berrysoju,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wkkyq/in_need_of_an_outsiders_perspectiveadvice_on/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wkkyq/in_need_of_an_outsiders_perspectiveadvice_on/,8848178,1682273559,0,,False,1682273570,1682273570,2023-04-23 18:12:39,,,

relationship_advice,"Hi all,

For starters I need to explain that I am a 25 y/o male who works for the military.

So about 5 weeks ago I matched with this 24 y/o female on the dating site Bumble. We seem to have really but it off when talking via text, but after each time we've met in person, she seems to go really quiet.

Her and her parents wre deeply religious. I think this is where troubles are starting to rise. The girl I'm talking with has mentioned me to her parents and they seem agitated with the thought of me dating or meeting up with their daughter.

Her parents have heard a lot of degrading stories about people in the military which is fueling their distain of me. 
They are mainly concerned about;
My job in general,
Military reputation,
How life would be like living with me,
The amount that I travel,
Complications that may come up as part of my job,
The fact that they think that she'd move out quicker with me than with other guys,
The fact that they think I'm pushy,
And finally my family as I've told her a couple stories of what my family is like behind closed doors.

I am wanting to meet with her parents so that I am able to talk through with them some misconceptions that they may have about me and my job, however, they don't seem to feel the same way.

I can honestly say that I deeply care for this girl, possibly getting to the point where I could say I'm in love with her, but I don't know if her parents are trying to control her life so much that it could ruin my/our chance at an amazing relationship.

If anyone has any tips or advice for me I would much appreciate the help

Also, if the girl in question reads this, hi 😜 yes I have had to come to strangers on Reddit for help as I don't know what to do X

TLDR: I matched and met with an amazing woman off a dating site but it seems like her parents are trying to stop me. Pls help

relationship_advice,"So this morning, my wife came home at around 6am from haning with her friends. That's no problem we live far from where they were so she had to pull over and sleep on the way home.

This morning, she asked me (at 9am) to get her her pills and maybe some breakfast. So I did but I accidently put too much sugar into her cereal and I got upset with the sugar container. I realized I took a bit of my frustration out of my wife when she asked for water when I came back. I didn't immediately apologize and I defended myself saying it was the sugar. Not my finest hour.

After defending myself, she basically said she's not gonna have sex with me anymore. I should just watch porn instead. She's ""done"" with me and she should just run away again.

Now I will say I wasn't the best this morning, I normally am in a good mood. However, lately I've been feeling distant from her. We hardly make love because of possible medical reasons. When I talk to her, she normally doesn't hear me (hyper focused on something) and so I just shut my mouth as there's no point.

The fact she's willing to run away from me and my daughter again really urks me. I know I'm not perfect, but almost everyday we've been together we have fought over dumb things. Like one time I left the bathroom door open while she was sleeping (a lot of light comes through) and I apologized but she still got pissed.

I also can't talk to her right now. She has walled me out so we can't figure this out together. I love her but after all this, I am slowly not caring about her anymore. On top of this she knows I'm going to school for her and our family to get a better job so this doesn't help mentally.

I know I'm the asshole right now, but what can I do to better this situation?

TL;DR my wife and I keep having small arguments and I am starting not to care about her anymore.

relationship_advice,"I (24M) have been talking to this guy (30M) for 2 months now. Last week, he came over to my place for the night. Everything was great, until later in the night when he became quiet and seemed to be in his head. I asked if everything was okay, in which he replied ‘yeah, just overthinking’. I asked if he wanted to discuss it further. He didn’t, so I left it at that. Later that night, I woke up twice to him just staring blankly at the ceiling. Again I asked if everything was okay, in which he insisted everything was fine. 

Woke up that morning and he immediately wanted to leave, saying he only got 30 minutes of sleep. Later that day he texted me apologizing, saying he was just thinking about a lot and it had ‘nothing to do’ with our relationship.

Saw him a few days later, and he seemed much better. Went to grab lunch and had a great time. That day, he invited me to his place the following Saturday to stay with him for the night. I excitedly agreed.

The following Saturday we went to a nature trail and went swimming. Everything seemed great, until we were on our way to dinner and he got really quiet. Again, I asked if he wanted to talk about something, in which he replied no. Things got better after dinner.

Later that night, after watching a movie, we both feel asleep. But yet again, I woke up three times in the middle of the night.. and he was up and staring at the ceiling all three times. He told me he couldn’t sleep because he was just ‘thinking’. In the morning, he was quiet and not talking.

I need advice. How do I go about this situation? I really like this guy, and he keeps telling me he likes me a lot, but his ‘overthinking’ is getting in the way of me wanting to further the relationship. 

[TLDR: Boyfriend of two months keeps telling me he has ‘a lot on his mind’, but won’t share what it is. He only tells me that it has nothing to do with our relationship and that I shouldn’t worry.

relationship_advice," Ok I have to give some context to this story, before I start: For a long time, I identified as gay. I realized in the past two years or so that this is not really true. I still think guys are attractive but sex with them never brought me joy. I now identify as somewhere on the asexual spectrum where I probably always were, but I needed some time to realize that. One reason for me to come to that realization was talking to my best friend, who always identified as asexual. When I talked to her about my experiences, I realized that there are a lot of similarities between us sexuality-wise.

I know her for nearly seven years now and I can honestly say that she is the person that is closest to me in the whole world. We basically text every day since the day we met. She is the only person in my life that I have such a connection with. During the past 1-2 years I realized that I really want a future with her. She is a psychotherapist in training and during one of the group sessions she did with her patients, she gave them the task to draw themselves where they saw themselves in ten years. For fun she did it too and sent me a picture afterwards of an appartement with two cats, herself and me. This made me really, really happy and warm inside and the wish for this kind of future has since manifested in me.

So, during the past year after this, we started regular video calls and watch a series together every week. We still do this and that is kind of part of the problem, but I'll come to that.

During one of her group therapy sessions with other psychotherapist trainees that she has to do in preparation for her job, she addressed her problem with romance and intimacy and one of the suggestions by the others to tackle that was, that she got an account on a dating app, just to try it out and to see, how she feels about it. When she told me that, I felt a hurt that I have never experienced before. I was never in love with anyone, and I don't think I'm ""in love"" with her in a romantic way but I definitely love her very much and I want to be with her.

Maybe that sounds strange, but I don't know how to explain it. I want to be with her and live with her and see her every day and make her breakfast. I don't want to kiss her, have sex with her or be otherwise intimately involved with her.

But back to the story. When she told me about her plan, I felt like crying for days. I debated with myself to let her know about my feelings, but I felt that it would be unfair to her, since she is trying to learn something about herself and maybe find a relationship to tackle her problems with romance and intimacy and be happier. And I don't want to be in the way for that. I just feel like: why not with me?

So, since this happened, she started seeing a guy who is objectively really sweet and nice. They had sex and she described it exactly like I felt about my sexual experiences - kinda boring and a bit like a chore. Every time she tells me about the guy, I feel really bad afterwards. Since we talk and text daily, I'm kinda always confronted with my feelings towards her. I feel kinda selfish for wanting her relationship to fail, but basically yeah - that's what I want. I still feel like I can't tell her my true feelings because that could destroy our friendship and that is the last thing that I want.

**TL,DR:** I feel horrible because my best friend is having a relationship and can't tell her about my feelings because that could possibly destroy our friendship. I have feelings for her, but I'm not classically and romantically in love with her.

I need advice on how to deal with this since I never felt about anyone like this but her. I don't want to risk our friendship, but this situation hurts me, and I don't see a way to solve it.",t2_8fb95bgy,0,I (24M) think I have feelings for my best friend (27F) who recently started seeing another guy.,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wjyjb,True,FullmetalDE,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wjyjb/i_24m_think_i_have_feelings_for_my_best_friend/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wjyjb/i_24m_think_i_have_feelings_for_my_best_friend/,8848076,1682272458,0,,False,1682272475,1682272475,2023-04-23 17:54:18,,,
relationship_advice,"Okay basically the title. We’ve been together 6 months and I’ve had ongoing health issues for the last 2 and he’s been incredible. He took me to accident and emergency on Thursday night at 6:30pm. We were there til 1am and he didn’t complain once, held my hair as I vomited etc. Thurs night I was told I had high liver enzymes and an enlarged spleen and would need to come back at 8am the next morning for an emergency scan etc. We sleep at mine briefly for a few hours but I’m still up vomiting for most of it. Boyfriend starts work 10 mins away from the hospital At 8am so rings his boss and asks if he can be a bit late to drop me off (I don’t drive.) I can barely stand unaided but he has to go so says let me know how it goes and leaves me there. This is not an issue I understand he has work and he was up late the night before with me. After hours of tests they tell me I’ll be kept in overnight until Saturday. I haven’t had a shower or change of clothes and am hoping boyfriend will offer but he is understandably exhausted from work and the previous night etc so doesn’t come visit and I stay the Friday night alone in hospital. On Saturday he has work again and I have more tests, scan at 1:30pm etc. Haven’t seen him since he dropped me off Fri morn. I for some reason wrongly assumed he’d come visit me when he finished work Saturday as his finish was meant to line up with my discharge time (6pm-ish.) He calls me from the car at 6:15pm saying he’s on the way home (30 mins away) but can always turn back around if I need him. I try and hide the disappointment in my voice but am like yeah of course, since he’s already headed that way and obviously didn’t plan on coming here. Again, he’s been at work and my discharge is running late anyway. It gets to around 8:30pm, things are running over, I’m still expected to be discharged that Saturday evening just later than expected. I call my boyfriend to tell him and he says he cannot come and pick me up when I’m discharged because he’s at the pub and been drinking but offers to send his mum instead. In typical hospital fashion it gets to past midnight before I’m discharged. I feel bad burdening his mum so late (she works very early) so I get a taxi home in the dark and I’m honestly kind of pissed off. He knew there would be a strong chance I’d get discharged that day and still went and drank. He said he did it because of the stress which adds guilt to me. Now It’s Sunday night and I’m not picking up his calls because I don’t want to fight but I’m still feeling let down. He doesn’t know I’m angry. His compromise was sending his mum but I was unwashed, upset and feeling rough and didn’t want her to see me in that state and already have issues feeling like a burden. Not sure what my next move should be

relationship_advice,"Two years ago I was with an ex with narcissistic tendencies. He would cheat and lie, then apologize with love bombing methods. Our fights were horrible and degrading. The break up was one of the worst things I’ve ever experienced, and I had to receive counseling.

Despite him giving me little reason to worry, I’ve noticed it as we get more serious residual thoughts from my past relationship have started to surface. I’m also starting to recognize my own toxic habits. 

For instance, my boyfriend travels for work, and I become incredibly anxious while he’s gone and check up on him constantly (my ex also used to travel and cheated while he was away). Also, I’ve asked to look through his phone for reassurance that he wasn’t hiding anything. 

While my boyfriend is incredibly understanding, I feel like a burden with all the reassurance I need. It’s humiliating and makes me feel vulnerable  We’ve been together now for eight months.

relationship_advice,"
Good day all, I am at a quandry and need some advice. 

I am a 36(M) widowed single father in a 2 month relationship with a 35(F) single mother. I currently live 7 hrs away and moving nearby due to work in the next couple months.

The relationship started really fun, texting stories, news, happy messages, etc. But then there were a few times it took a while for me to text back (couple hrs) as I was busy with my move, paperwork, job, kid or something other task. She got very upset. I tried to adapt to let her know when I will be unavailable, but I still have a lot going on with my move, and all. (Purchasing and selling a house on my own is taxing). So I told her when I would be available for chats and games, etc today. Window of about two hrs, and she tells me that that sucks and she's worried about our relationship. Mind you we just got back from a 5day vacation together 2 days ago. 

There was another circumstance in which I was going to call her in the morning. I called her at 9am and she got upset I didn't call earlier. 

She doesn't have a job due to being disabled, so her days kind of consist of gaming, boardgames, art, and spending time with her kid. 

I don't really feel like I get a lot of ""me"" time. To focus and unwind. And honestly it feels like codependency maybe? I tried to talk to her about it once and she got upset saying that she wants a relationship that in which the partners want to talk to each other and share their lives together. 

 Idk what to do y'all. Any advice would be good.

relationship_advice,"TLDR: I have has feelings for my best friend since the beginning of the pandemic, I have autism and ADHD and he is autistic too.  We are both asexual and I keep thinking it's an autistic obsession but it's not going away, but I don't know if he is even interested.

I met him through a convention, and we have been ride or die since.  We share the same passions and I think that he is the kindest most considerate and generous person in the world.

We share friends and he actually dated one of my other friends pre coming out and transition, and that's awkward but I still feel the same, even though I don't even know if being in a relationship is something he wants, or if he could be in a relationship with me after being in a relationship with the mutual friend.  He has primarily dated men before but that was before his transition.

We always have these incredible deep and meaningful conversations, tell each other we love each other several times a day, but I don't know if I'm misreading signs.

I'm incredibly jealous when he spends time with anybody else but me, but we also live 300 miles apart, but we talk every day and see each other in London when we can.

There will never be anybody else for me but this man, but I'm so scared of ruining it by telling him about my feelings.

relationship_advice,"New to reddit, so please be kind, lol! 

TLDR: 
We were both blindsided by my sudden &amp; intense! sexual awakening &amp; interest in ENM. Hubby would prefer we both be monogamous. I'm taking a step back from ENM to figure things out now, &amp; I find myself sexually offline again. (Nooooooo!)

Advice welcome. Empathy for my husband will definitely get communicated to him. 

Long (did I  mention, long?) story:

By the end of last year, I was fed up with the sexual dynamic in my marriage. I was just DONE with the guilt I felt about *never* being able to match his passion and enthusiasm for sex. He was so patient. He never complained. But that look on his face, every time I'd turn him on without even trying, and it wasn't reciprocated... ouchies for us both.

If I didn't have memories of being totally into it during our first year of marriage ❤️‍🔥 I would have thought I was asexual, that's how low my libido was. 

He's amazing in bed. Always made sure I was very well satisfied. We've had sex 2x/wk or more for the vast majority of our marriage. But no matter how good it was, it didn't translate into my being enthusiastic about getting it on later. Always happy to humor him but hardly ever really... actually feeling authentic desire for it. Hurry and let's get this overwith was how I felt almost every time. Poor guy.

Enough was enough. He might have the ability to be long suffering but I love him too much to keep this up.

I had ditched the super-conservative religion we both grew up in and I knew he was close to abandoning that ship, too. No more purity culture rules. He'd been fantasizing about 3somes for a long long time, let's look into making that happen.

While keeping him in the loop, I was investigating what an open marriage dynamic would look like. We are both coming from a super sheltered background. (Until this year, I had never even looked at porn, my whole entire life, you guys. My church said not to, but also, it never was interesting to me.) 

I didn't know where to start. Hadn't figured out yet what reddit was, Facebook is a ghost town now, &amp; my Google skills are extremely lacking, but after a month of investigating, I'd learned just enough to know that ENM seemed worth looking into. 

In early January I thought maybe a dating app would be a good way to ask questions of people who were actually living the lifestyle. I tried to be very clear that I was just there doing research, lol. Not there to hook up. 🤣

One guy being flirty with me anyway was all it took to trigger a MAJOR sexual awakening.

Like, it flipped that whole system online for me in a way I've nnnnnnnever ever experienced. It hit me like a train. This 5 cent investment of just giving my consent to let a stranger be flirty and share his very low-grade, pg-rated fantasies about me... bam. All of a sudden, I'm all systems go. 

(I didn't fall for that guy, btw. I was skeptical and suspicious about meeting some random person. While we were texting, it was just fascinating and amazing to me, observing how my body and mind were reacting to it. If that makes sense.) 

Turns out, I totally enjoyed some other guy being into me. It's super fun. Go figure. And I unleashed all this newfound sexual energy on my husband that night.

I pounced on him with more passion and enthusiasm than he's ever experienced before. It was incredible. 

All of a sudden, I totally understood why sex is such a big deal to people. It was by far the most intense experience of my life. Scared the shit out of my husband, though. Ha. Oops. Can't blame him. It was a radical change, to go from zero to a hundred like that. 

There were so many things that I've never in life been able to do. Other things I'd done (as infrequently as possible) &amp; not really truly enjoyed authentically, if I was being honest - and now they're like the best thing ever.

Waking up all of a sudden like this, it felt like I'd been crippled before and not known it. Like I'd been totally in the dark and all of a sudden someone turned on the lights.

So anyway.
Here's where the plot thickens.

Hubby discovered immediately that his fantasies about other women vanished. All he's really ever wanted was *me* to be enthusiastically into him sexually. 

Now that I check that box, he's not all that interested in anything the ENM world has to offer.  Would *much* rather be monogamous -- and would also much much much rather me be monogamous too. That's a big part of it for him. He basically begged me to stay off that app &amp; let us both adjust to this change in me together. Approach the open marriage dynamic idea more slowly if at all. 

But... I mean, hello. This awakening happened in a trying-to-be-ethically-non-monogamous situation. Nothing I'd tried inside our marriage had lit me up like that. Not even close.

It felt to me like it was the dynamic of having other guys in the picture that really gave me this access to my own sexuality. Even if it was just chatting. Something about that just makes me want my husband so much more, and enjoy things with him in a totally new way. Like all the familiar stuff is brand new again if there are other guys in the periphery.

I was terrified of losing the connection to this part of me that I've never felt before. The whole world looked better and brighter. I was rather unwilling to take a break from ENM when I had just barely found it. I hadn't even done anything with anyone yet!

I waited until I  truly had his consent to kiss another guy, which we both viewed as an experiment - and then it was basically game over for my giving up EMM. I did try to humor him a couple times when attachment insecurity &amp; (justified 😭) sense of betrayal here would kick up, but and it just didn't stick. I couldn't give it up altogether. 

For me, it made marriage &amp; sex amazing. 

So we awkwardly tried to have an open marriage dynamic this year even though he didn't want to. It was basically poly-under-duress, but I really couldn't understand why it was so hard for him. If I kept him informed about what I was doing, it was ethical, right? And if it has this kind of impact on me... clearly, it's a good thing. How could he not just love it???

And he did love my being so sexually online finally. He loved me being happy. I kept my activities outside marriage way way limited (in person stuff happened very very infrequently and really never went farther than kissing, technically. Long story) --  

but it was crushing him that I had other interests at all. 

Sometimes he'd seem okay, but sometimes reeeeeally not. He found a therapist to work with early on. It took me longer but I found one too. And in the meantime I was genuinely trying to figure things out. 

Hubby tried to join me in this ENM world, and that was super cringey/awkward because he definitely didn't really authentically want to be there. He was only trying to put himself out there because it felt to him like he needed to have his own adventures out there or leave me. 

It was a horrible yoyo this year of my holding back for him, him trying to open up for me and be okay with it, me having this awful stop/go dynamic in these other relationships that were emerging...
Ugh. 

So. 
Eventually I got enough control of myself to see what was happening and I decided to stop everything. I can't do this any more.

It was a good call. We need to figure this shit out *before* I'm anywhere near a dating app again. Obviously. I committed to at least 30 days of nothing at all outside marriage. Not even texting with the guys I'd been close to. This break was my idea and I truly see the need for it. 

I get that I was a complete asshole to basically ignore my husband's pleas to stay monogamous. I'm grateful he's forgiving and wants to work things out. We really do love each other. He knew I didn't want to hurt him, my adhd brain was just blind-sided by how fun sexy stuff can be. (Oh, the dopamine!) 

He doesn't blame me but that doesn't mean it didn't break his trust in me and hurt like hell. 

This is my time to figure out what I really need - and attempt to repair the broken trust etc. At this point I can see that it might take a *lot* longer than 30 days. 

So now...
It's been ~2 weeks now that I've been on this break. I'm sexually offline again. (Nooooooooo!) That fell apart for me almost immediately when I withdrew from my other tryingtobeethical connections. 

Like, I'm basically back to where I was before, but now we both know what I'm capable of. 

It suuuuuuuucks.

I'm: 
- reading Come as You Are, Polysecure, and Open Deeply. 
- working with a therapist (as noted) and 
- pouring through everything I can find here in relevant reddit communities. 
- journaling and trying to figure out what exactly was the magic that unlocked things for me, and how the hell do I get back to that... 

Can I even get there inside monogamy? 
If not, is there a way to more gently open the marriage so we're both on the same page and genuinely okay with it?

I love this guy. We're raising kids together. We're a good team. He's amazing in so many ways, don't even get me started.

relationship_advice,"Hi everyone, I’m currently seeing this guy for the last few months. We get along really well, and he’s charming, witty, smart, and overall I am just super attracted to him. We see each other every weekend and both would make time for each other after work on the weekdays. A few weeks into us seeing each other—at this point we saw each other 2-3 times a week—I suggested that maybe we could exclusively see each other since that was the natural progression of how things were going since we saw each other so often and admitted feelings to one another. 

He wasn’t the most perfect guy, as I feel the need to get out there. He tends to have a very unserious side to him and admits to not being able to be held accountable for anything, but claims he goes to therapy to work on it. But, I got the emotional side of me to take over and I raised the question anyways. 

He agreed and we became exclusive, and up until this point I had no suspicion or distrust towards him. We even talked about old flings, baggage, and past relationships. He told me about his serious relationships and about this one girl he was seeing before me and how she ended up friend-zoning him. I eventually went on a work trip for a week and we still would call everyday/text. While I was away, we were planning a date with each other for when I came back and he started acting extremely weird, saying cryptic things such as “I don’t know if I can see you that day—something came up.” I started feeling suspicious and pressed him for more information, and he said he had promised his “college friend” that he would take her to a school event. 

I know this didn’t make sense right away since we were both out of college so what school event? He had recently moved to the area with none of his college friends nearby. I said this and he clarified that was grad school and started to get snarky with me. When he mentioned the grad school name I immediately connected the dots to the girl he was seeing before, who was currently attending that school. I asked if it was her, and he vehemently denied it, saying no, but said “well, they actually know each other.”

I knew immediately this was BS, and when I arrived back home from the airport I phoned him, telling him to be honest with me. He ended up confessing that the girl had reached out to him a few weeks ago and they started seeing each other as just “friends”, studying together or hanging out. He argued that he had previously agreed to go to the event with her and didn’t want to let her down. It was then that I realized he had been lying to me throughout the last month. 

I immediately ended things there and went about my weekend. I was upset, but not as upset as I could have been because I was preoccupied with work and other things in my life. Come Monday, I get a phone call from him late at night apologizing for lying to me. He sends me a screenshot of him texting the girl admitting everything, showing me the name (“Kathy”)  and everything and then claiming he blocked her afterwards. He asked for a second chance, and I stupidly gave in.  We ended up spending more and more time together, spending consecutive days together. I met his friends, he met mine, and he ended telling me he loved me, which took me by complete surprise. 

I couldn’t help but still feel wary despite how well things were going, so one day when he stepped out, I peeked through his journal he had on his desk. I know I shouldn’t have read it, but there were several entries in there about me and the other girl. I felt my stomach drop, seeing the entry on the date he reached out to  me again he wrote “I can’t stop thinking about Bethany. She’s probably ghosting me again, I don’t know what to do.” I realized that the screenshot and name he showed me was a fake name and that her real name wasn’t Kathy. I also realized that he reached out to me probably after realizing she was “ghosting him.”

I felt like shit, confronted him without telling him I read his journal. He claims he loved me, and he wanted to be with me, but I knew his journal entries suggests otherwise. His entries mentioned how well he and I got along, and how much time we spent together and how he was worried that he would be “be pressured to be more.” But to my face, he kept suggesting we were together, that we should officially date, and that he loved me and etc. 

I tried to focus on what he told me rather than what I found out by reading his journal, but I can’t help but remember how he supposedly really feels. What felt like a breaking point was how last night, he ended up meeting a few more of my friends, after he told me that morning he wanted to be my boyfriend, he ended up bugging out once they left. Saying, “this isn’t gonna work out” and “we need to end this.” It felt like a weird episode, where he left my house and stood out for 30 minutes and came back in saying all of this. I ended up crying and saying OK, and showed him out the door. I figured as soon as he saw I was actually letting him go, he said “I change my mind we’re staying together!” in a very strange, 180 mood flip. I was in disbelief at just what happened, and he claims he has these moments of feeling like “he’s on a war path” and “says things he doesn’t mean” but he “didn’t actually want to lose me because he loved me.”

so likely what he's trying to say is he doesn't want his family to be part of the wedding or have them meet up with my family.. So it kind of worries me.. and as much as I tried to convince him, his answer would still be the same and he says that he's willing to compromise with everything but not this.. it just makes me really sad and I also wanted to understand on his part, which is he actually doesn't have a good childhood or memories with his family.. but then again I also love my family and atleast wanted to get my family to bond with his..

I actually already met his family and he already met mine, and I could say that his family are actually good people.. and I just can't seem to understand why he doesn't like them or forgave them.. but he says that he'd still be there for them if they needed him, he just doesn't like em to be part of his important events...

His family is rather dysfunctional as his mom has mental issues but it hasn't been something that's affected me directly since she's always been nice and cordial with me, He's been clear about his previous bouts with depresion and i have not seen him depressed nor dysfunctional, At around the 3 month mark I told a friend she was outright opposed to our relationship and it created doubts in my mind since I wasn't sure he was right for me, My family has given me mixed signals about him since they feel that he's not enough for me, They are very controlling and i do try to speak up but I end up crossing my arms and just let it be, By December at our 6month mark he had a breakdown, he was about to get evicted due to an error in his apartment in which the owner wasn't he was paying on time and it was resolved within a few days but he's always been supportive about my doubts and on that day he broke down and outright refused to listen to me or even support me, He said he's done enough to prove he's perfect for me and he asked for space and gave me the option to break with him, He didn't go to our new years party and i broke up with him on the 3rd of Jan, For 7 days we argued and he refused to give me another chance and at the 8th day he said he couldn't anymore and asked me to get back together, Idk why but I refused and long story short we've tried to get together multiple times and at around Valentine's day I left him waiting for me.

Everything changed on that day and yes we got back together eventually, his demeanor of being supportive and loving is there but he's been clear that this is the last time and at first I didn't believe him but lack of crying or showing any emotion at all in the matter of us breaking up again is proof enough he's serious.

Yesterday my mom found out about us and refused to let me go on a date with him, He spent 4 hours under the sun near my house waiting for my mother to come home so he could face her and ask for permission, He got severaly sun burned and refused to leave unless we outright broke up, He said he's either giving it his all or we break up with no method of contact whatsoever afterwards, my mom was very rude to him for no reason at all and she did eventually agreed but it's obvious she's biased against him, He's been distant and even tho he says he loves me he feels something broke inside of him and I'm afraid of losing him.

I love this man to death and he's been excelent and has shown he loves me to death, Even outright paying for my college expenses and supporting me in my worst times.

I don't want to lose him but I feel like I am slowly because I don't give him as much priority as he gives me...",t2_60wjd4tg,0,My family hates my (26M) BF and i (22F) i feel i don't appreciate him enough,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wirkj,True,PaleBoomer,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wirkj/my_family_hates_my_26m_bf_and_i_22f_i_feel_i_dont/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wirkj/my_family_hates_my_26m_bf_and_i_22f_i_feel_i_dont/,8847846,1682270314,0,,False,1682270328,1682270329,2023-04-23 17:18:34,,,

relationship_advice,"It’s gotten to the point where I need some internet advice from strangers lol

I’ve been seeing this girl since November 2022, so about 6 months ish. She is a sweetheart and one of the kindest souls I have met. We play fortnite together and (tmi: she’s the best I’ve ever had in the bedroom). She’s given me stuffed animals that match my vibe and she’s also gotten me really cute/funny gifts (one of which is a button that when you press is says Bazinga in sheldon’s voice from the big bang theory). I am a standup comedian, and she is supportive of it and is (usually) okay with me being out 3-6 nights a week perusing comedy. Also we live at our respective homes and are about a 15 minute drive from each-other.


Here comes the complicated parts:


We never made things official but she has recently been trying to pressure me into it because it’s what she wants. I have been transparent since the day she and I met that I am not looking for anything monogamous. We had a talk the other day about how if we were to make thing official, I want to be in an open relationship. I’m fairly spiritual and I live in a very “fuck around and find out” way (I’m a comedian, it yields fun experiences and gives me great stories), but she isn’t down for that. After I recently reminded her how I want that at this point in my life, she kept saying how she’ll never be enough for me and that she was having thoughts of relapsing (self harm).

For more context she is extremely depressive and was recently in an intensive outpatient program due to suicidal ideation. Also her mother is an extremely toxic person in her life, and while the father is lovely, he enables both the mother’s alcoholism and her BS.

I do have a lot of love for her, and she is a sweetheart not only to me, but to my 3 younger siblings and my mother (who all adore her, and are also understanding of my situation). However, I feel like the situation with her is getting unhealthy, and I can’t put myself through a relationship with someone who needs as much support as she does. I don’t blame her obviously, as she has diagnosed mental illnesses, but even with those put aside it feels like I’m trying to jam two puzzle pieces together that just kind of don’t fit. She and I click in so many ways but we simply want different things. It sucks because we really do have love for each other, but I’ve been in an extremely toxic relationship before and I’m starting to see some signs that the relationship may be taking that turn. She’s said that she wouldn’t be able to handle being ‘just friends’ because we’ve already ‘done so much’. I really don’t want to break her heart and I REALLY don’t want her to not be in my life, as I really do care about her and I want to be there for her as she has no other friends, but I feel like breaking up is the right choice to make. 

Any advice would be more than welcomed please 🙏

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I have been together for over  a year now. In the beginning he was already kind of hot and cold (wouldn't hear something from him for quite a while and he'd ignore me sometimes in person as well). Now it's just downright ridiculous. 

I've come out of a mental and physical abusing relationship &gt; 2,5 years ago and I still feel kind of insecure in some situations, even with the help of my therapist. So I just really need something stable. 

The thing is he tells me how much he loves me, how he wants to see the world with me, plans our next gazillion dates etc. The next moment (literally 2 minutes later) he just doesn't respond when I ask him something and says he is interested in other people except for me. (After we've talked about relationship) When I later confront him about the situation above, he says he understands, but he can't always give me attention. All fair and square i alsof know I need quite some attention, but just walking off or not responding to text or calls for multiple days (even though he's online every 5 minutes) seems kind of harsh to me...

I really don't know what to do, because we can talk until 7 in the morning, he does so much for me when he's in a good mood. But on the other hand he seems to only have interest in me when he has need for romance. He just doesn't give me any attention at all on the days when he's not super clingy. 

How do I handle this? I know it might be best to end it if it makes me unhappy, but on good days he can also be the best boyfriend i've ever had...

relationship_advice,"If you see my previous post, you will see the trauma from my previous relationship. I'm trying to navigate a new one. 

I'm still testing negative after 5 months...

We have been dating for a few months. We have seen each other every single weekend. One weekend, I had to leave the state, so he went on a trip with one of his guy friends. He expected me to come too, and automatically booked it for us as well, but I couldnt go. 

I knew it meant we wouldnt see each other for a couple weeks, but i was ok with that. Time apart is healthy.

He wanted to see me during the week, but I couldnt.

I've realized that I've asked him to meet up, probably 85% of the time. On fridays I ask if we're  meeting up (he always says of course, as if it's a silly question). I told him I didn't want to steal all his weekends and I've suggested not meeting up on a weekend to give him some ""weekend"" space. He said that was ridiculous and asked ""how are we supposed to build our relationship"" if we spend so much time apart. 

I decided not to say anything about meeting up this weekend, and aside from a ""good morning, beautiful"" yesterday and a short conversation, we haven't spoken. 

 I'm working on being more secure and not jumping to conclusions. 

I've met all his friends and everything has been beautiful 

His friend even pulled me aside and told me how much he likes me and that I better not hurt him (so cute haha)

I've asked him about spending too many consecutive days together every single weekend and he reassures me that he loves it. (He really seems to be happy when we are together. Nonstop fun and laughing and dancing and joking). He also never wants me to leave. We spend a TON of time with his friends too. His friends even invite me out. I really like them

My discomfort is the overnight change in dynamics and because I didn't initiate meeting up, we didn't meet up at all this weekend and havent spoken since Friday. He had an incredibly stressful week at work, but has been hanging with friends during the week despite that. I work some weekends, so I won't be able to meet next weekend. 

TL;DR Guy I'm seeing rarely initiates meeting up, but seems excited when we are together. Our dynamic seemed to have changed overnight and I don't know what to make of it.

relationship_advice,"This guy and I have been fwb for about 1.5 years now. We met on Facebook dating a couple years ago and we actually worked at the same place before that. So we started hanging out after we talked for a little bit. We’ve never been on any dates or anything we only hookup and that’s it. I have noticed that I maybe kinda started catching feelings not too long ago but I’m perfectly okay with our relationship and what it is right now. He’s always lasted like the perfect amount of time before finishing during sex and we always have really good sex. We’re super comfortable with each other and have a great rhythm. But the last two times we’ve had sex he’s finished a lot sooner than he normally does. Before this we could get like three positions in and do all of them for a good amount of time but now we’ll start off in one position and he’ll finish after doing that position for a couple minutes. I’m not disappointed or anything, I love having sex with him and just spending time with him. I just feel like he gets upset with himself and feels bad. We haven’t really talked about it at all cuz we are just fwb so I don’t know if I should mention it at all. I don’t know why he’s finishing earlier than usual.

relationship_advice,"We are 31F and 33M been together about 14 years the tldr is he insists on making breakfast in bed for me and it's exclusively food that makes me sick. 
.
.
.
.



He likes to make me breakfast in bed, especially when I'm annoyed with him, but for so many reasons I hate this. 

Primarily it's because I don't eat in the morning. He knows this. The meds I take make me extremely nauseous to the point that if I even sneeze in the morning I'll start gagging. Forget eating. I can usually only manage cold things in the morning so a common breakfast for me is iced coffee and some fruit. 

Another reason I dislike this gesture is because I never eat in bed or in my room at all. I don't want the crumbs and I don't want bugs. 

The breakfast he most often makes for me is toast, with bacon and egg. I don't hate this meal in general I just can't eat it in the morning without feeling incredibly sick. In addition to my meds making me nauseous I also have digestive issues so these items give me indigestion. It's an entirely unpleasant thing for me. 

He will also give me a hot coffee that he makes waaaaaayyy too sweet. So I'm stuck in bed until I drink enough of the coffee so I can move without spilling.

To set the scene he wakes me up for this, like pulls me from a cold dead sleep at fuck ass a.m. in the morning to make me a hot breakfast in bed that will 100% make me sick. He hands me a coffee so sweet I can feel my cavities growing. It's too hot and the cup is too full for me to move to set it down anywhere. So I hold the coffee with one hand and attempt to eat with the other because I am now surrounded by our 3 pets begging me and without a table or a free hand it's a struggle to fend them off. I'm getting crumbs all over the bed and all the while my hair tie and glasses are completely out of reach. I hate every single moment of this. 

His ego is extraordinarily fragile and I was raised in a hell hole of 0 tolerance for feedback and unclean plates so I always end up eating it anyways and making my morning horrible without so much as a word to him other than ""thank you"". 

On top of this I am the only one who cleans. This is not by choice unfortunately. So I get to wake up early on a weekend, eat something that makes me sick, clean the bed and then clean the kitchen that was left a mess for me. 

I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GESTURE and all I want is for it to completely and totally stop. How do I get this through to him without causing a scene? 

He already knows I don't take my coffee this way and that these things make me sick so I honestly don't know why he keeps doing it unless he just doesn't care that I'm sick if he gets to pat himself on the back for making things 'all better' or whatever it is he convinces himself of. 

We've been together since 2009 and shared an address since 2010. He knows me. He knows what I do and don't like. I don't know what to say that I haven't already said. 

Financially we really can't afford for me to just not eat it or throw it away.

relationship_advice,"I want to start off by saying that I was full-blown cheated on in my previous relationship. It was kept secret from me by him for months and I found out myself about a week before we were due to move across the country together and start our lives. At the time I felt trapped and that I had no choice but to stay with him. Needless to say, we’re not together anymore and at that point, I checked out of the relationship and could never love him the same again. 

Flash forward to today. I (M) found out that my boyfriend of 5 months cheated on me. Now, the way he did it is not nearly as bad as many cases and definitely not as bad as when I was cheated on by my now-ex. [the following is somewhat NSFW so read with caution]. Long story short, we’re in a long-distance relationship and he was traveling into NYC yesterday. He saw two guys cruising and decided to join in unprompted. He said there was no touching involved and he looked at the other guys but tried to turn away from them so they couldn’t see him (but either way it’s likely they saw his penis anyway). After finishing, he left and got on his train at Grand Central station. 

He told me as soon as he’d gotten back home and we called. I could tell how awful he felt and felt pretty horrible myself. Despite being cheated on before, he’s never once made me feel worried that he’d cheat on me. 

Comparing this to my last relationship, I know it’s not nearly as bad. He told me immediately versus having me find out months later, and the action didn’t involve any hands-on contact with others. However, be joined in entirely unprompted versus being coaxed by someone else. Am I just trying to justify this because I’m scared to lose him?

I’ve been in a few long  (1-3 year) relationships. I’ve never loved someone like this boy and was confident he was the one for me. After finding, out I’m stuck. Do I give him another chance and move forward in our relationship, or do I draw the line here and end things with him? The thought of losing him is terrifying because I’ve never loved someone like this. But if I move forward and try to grow with him, I can’t help but feel like it’ll be like my last relationship where I check out and slowly fall out of love until we’re both miserable.

title pretty much says it. ive been seeing this guy for about two months, and things are going well as far as i can tell. unfortunately, a close family member of his passed away recently and he flew out of state for the memorial this week and i havent rly heard from him since hes been back. i know hes hurting and it hurts me that i cant help him. i know him well enough to know that he is the strong/silent type, distances himself when he’s struggling. i understand that, and i have been respectful of his need for space. i only texted him to check in after a few days of not hearing from him, and asked him to pls communicate his needs to me so i can do my part to meet them. he told me he just wants to be alone, so i’m leaving him alone. it feels weird to me tho to be completely cast aside and ignored for a week, and i am starting to feel self conscious that maybe i like him too much and maybe he doesnt like me very much if hes okay to just not see me or even text me for like a whole week. please tell me if im overthinking. im sure i am. i live alone and dont rly have anyone to bounce my thoughts off of to make sure im valid. i feel bad for him and feel useless that i cant fix anything and unwanted and not needed. im really trying to respect his wishes but at the same time like…this doesnt feel good for me either and im driving myself crazy not knowing what to do. thanks in advance guys",t2_8k6kk,0,"guy 31M im 27F seeing has ghosted me all week while he’s grieving, how can i express a boundary without sounding like a selfish asshole?",[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12whxmy,True,katie_patra,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12whxmy/guy_31m_im_27f_seeing_has_ghosted_me_all_week/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12whxmy/guy_31m_im_27f_seeing_has_ghosted_me_all_week/,8847725,1682268815,0,,False,1682268827,1682268827,2023-04-23 16:53:35,,,

So it's as the title says, me 24F and my boyfriend 26M haven't been intimate in a while and I'm talking going on 9 months. I have spoken to him regarding this and he has said that he still find me attractive and wants to be with me. From his has said to me when I have asked what was the reason for just stopping it was for him to not constantly grope me whenever he is round me, he used to do it constantly and it did get a bit much for me. I have self confidence issues that both of us are aware of and he respects my boundaries however it just seems to me like we have hit a stalemate. There was one time that he did touch me intimately but I got confused, scared because I didn't know how to react after not being touched like that in so long. I'll be honest I don't know how to be sexy or anything like I wouldn't know how to say I want to have 3ex without getting embarrassed about it. I also don't know if the problem is me as well cause I don't see the joy of being intimate anymore, I loved just being beside him after cuddling. Don't get me wrong I still love him but I just think maybe after all this time without being with him like that, mentally I'm blocking that part out of my life with him.

relationship_advice,"Reddit, I am looking for some advice on how to approach this situation. 
A week ago my stepdad sent me an email where he revealed (for whatever messed up reason) that he has been in love with another woman his whole life and still thinks about her to this day. Then he went on to say that he has been seeing another young woman in her 20s for the last year, and to top that off, that he is also in love with me. 
I couldn’t believe what fucked up shit I was reading. I am so disgusted and boiling over with anger, and I don’t know how to handle this person. I feel incredibly sad for my mother and all that she’s had to put up with in the 20 years of their marriage, which has been rocky to begin with. 

I’m looking for any advice on how to break this to my mother and get her out of the situation in the most delicate and safe manner. She has a lot of stress already and I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

I have been trying to limit my interactions with him ever since I moved out to go to college. He always seems to try to drag me into situations/ problems between him and my mom and it really weighs heavy on me and causes a lot of distress. He tends to ruminate over situations, build his own perception of reality in his head and then act on it in ways that are just delusional.

For some context, the relationship between my mother and him has been strained for many years. Growing up, I have also had plenty of issues with him and feel frustrated about how he has treated her. He is quick to lose his temper and generally only cares about his needs/wants, and will not listen to anything you have to say because he’s convinced he knows what you’re thinking and feeling and what’s best for you. I would describe him as emotionally abusive. He does not appreciate my mother for all the things she is doing to help keep them afloat - while she works a strenuous low paying full time job and takes care of the house and all chores, he sits at home all day and doesn’t lift a finger and just collects SS. You couldn’t ask him to help out because he blows up and talks about how much he has done for this family. Divorce has been thrown around plenty of times. Financially it has always been hard on them because he couldn’t keep any job for very long, so they’ve stuck together to make ends meet and are dependent on each other financially. Pretty much most of his family and old friends have gone no/limited contact because of his behavior and offensive comments. He generally rubs people the wrong way and can’t keep relationships. I think he has mental health issues and lives in his own reality and can’t put himself in other peoples shoes. Since they’ve been struggling financially, they are planning to move to a LCOL country by the end of the year, which would also allow for my mother to be closer to her family (although still in another country).  

I can’t see how this can keep going. I’ve talked to my mom in the past few months to leave him and get a divorce, but she is afraid that she can’t do it and doesn’t want to put financial strain on me to support her. The only option she sees if she leaves him is to go back to her old life where she says she has no future. We are from a country that is currently very unstable, but my mom does have an apartment there and would be able to afford living there on her own and take care of her mother.",t2_7seb8rum,0,I (F29) found out my stepdad (M70) is cheating on my mother (F57),[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12whsa5,True,Radiant-Cricket-3568,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12whsa5/i_f29_found_out_my_stepdad_m70_is_cheating_on_my/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12whsa5/i_f29_found_out_my_stepdad_m70_is_cheating_on_my/,8847693,1682268546,0,,False,1682268558,1682268559,2023-04-23 16:49:06,,,

Most of them are also girl photoshopped from butt to breast and it makes me uncomfortable… he told me to not worry and since he was also worries I might talk to other guys (which is not happening) he said that it will be wrong and he doesn’t want to fck things up.

relationship_advice,"I (28F) was dating my ex (32M) exclusively from March 2022 - November 2022. Our relationship was long distance from one European capital to another. He was loving and attentive to the point of adulation. The relationship was serious and was driven completely by him. He would make most of the effort to travel to see me, however we also had multiple trips together across Europe. 

He moved back to the US in July and we decided to continue the relationship with the extra distance. He continued to be just as loving, enthusiastic, and attentive. He had a flight booked to see me in November, however approximately a week beforehand he did a 180 and broke up with me suddenly, the day after a care package for him from me arrived. I was awoken by the phone call which was cold and cruel. It was like speaking with a different person. 

I’ve moved on very well from this, however this week my friend informed me that she saw online that he is engaged to his ex. They have a date set, a venue booked, and a wedding website created for summer 2024. The timeline is far too quick for there not to be an overlap of him dating us both: for us to break up in November, them to get together, get engaged, and have the all major elements of a wedding planned by April is just not feasible (at the latest, April is just when I became aware of this, they could have been engaged long beforehand). 

What troubles me even more is that this ex is someone I caught him texting when we were at dinner last June. This makes me think that potentially not only was there an overlap of him dating us both at the same time towards the end of our relationship, but that he was, in fact, also with her for the entirety of it. I asked him who she was at the time and he said it was a friend before admitting it was an ex. I was irked and requested that he not text an ex when he was at dinner with me, however said he was free to remain in contact with her should he wish (I’m not a controlling person and I didn’t feel threatened). He assured me he had no interest in her anymore and further had extremely damning things to say about her. He said that she had a terrible temper, was highly volatile and physically abusive towards him (I felt heartbroken for him at the time and gave him the space to talk about it, however I strongly question the truth of this now). 

My question is what to do? Some of my friends believe it’s my ‘girl code’ duty to let his fiancée know. However, I have to be honest that I don’t want to message as much as I feel deeply, deeply sorry for her. The thought makes me highly anxious.

The breakup was the worst of my life and I’m proud of my resilience in coming back stronger and happier than ever. I don’t think it’s my responsibility to plunge myself back into anxiety to deal with the affects of his unethical behaviour when I did nothing wrong. I realise this may be selfish.

relationship_advice,"My gf and I have been together for a little over 4 years now. It was the standard high school sweethearts story. Met freshman year and showed mutual interest, but didn’t lock it in until late sophomore year and have been together since. It was a rocky road to begin with, as she was raised by a single father and has some major emotional baggage, but I was willing to help her bc I loved her and i love helping out anybody I know in any way I can. Eventually we made it through, and everything began to improve now that she wasn’t constantly in a down state or upset about her circumstances. She helped me out a lot too, I had a not so great childhood growing up too so we were both very loving and supportive of each other. I’ve always enjoyed our relationship, even to this day. I overlooked some of the aspects of our relationship bc i love her and I wanted to try and make it work. But lately they’ve been popping into my head and for some reason I can’t get past those things now and idk what to do. There’s nothing materially wrong with our relationship, we love each other, the lovemaking is good, and we get along just fine. But certain aspects have been bugging me lately, such as how it seems like we always get into some argument every time we hangout. We always talk it out and make up, but it seems like our arguments always stem from our differences. She likes movies, I don’t watch them often. My love language is touch, and she can’t be bothered to take the 2 mins to scratch my back if I ask her to (even though when she needs a back massage I do it for her). She doesn’t like it when I play video games or hangout with my coworkers because it’s taking time away from her (even though she does the same thing and I tell her it’s fine bc Ik she doesn’t hang out with her friends often. She doesn’t take care of herself well (ie doesn’t eat well, drinks minimal water and always finds herself on the verge of passing out at work). She’s always asking me what to do about this or how to go about doing that, and I try to help her the best I can. I get that she grew up with a single father and that he wasn’t the best parent at times (her words not mine) but sometimes I find myself being more of a parent than a boyfriend, and the more I reflect on it, that’s not what I want out of a relationship. She can’t cook (doesn’t insist on learning how even though I encourage her to a lot), she refuses to try and do anything with me that I like to do (even though she tries to force me to do the things that she likes) and the more and more I reflect on it, I just feel like she isn’t the right fit. And for anyone wondering, yes we are young, and I do feel as that might be a contributing factor as well. Idk what to do, and I just want somebody else’s thoughts on this.",t2_8mtsl4mkg,0,I (20m) am going to break up with my gf(19f) and she doesn’t see it coming,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12whp09,True,ThrowRAthatoneguylol,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12whp09/i_20m_am_going_to_break_up_with_my_gf19f_and_she/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12whp09/i_20m_am_going_to_break_up_with_my_gf19f_and_she/,8847673,1682268377,0,,False,1682268388,1682268389,2023-04-23 16:46:17,,,

relationship_advice,"We met at work over two years ago and instantly became very good friends. We would message constantly throughout the day on Teams and then off-work through Messenger; that's never really changed and you could fill a book with all the messages we've sent. And they're sometimes just banter and inside jokes, but we also tend to support each other through hardships and low moods, too. In fact we seem to be amongst the first people we turn to when we have problems. 

We were both in long-term relationships at the start, however, so nothing happened. My relationship ended a year ago and hers a month ago, so we're both now single. We spent the afternoon together yesterday shopping and having dinner, and it just felt wonderful. It's so easy between us and we have a definite affinity. It was really hard not to think how lovely it would be if that were an everyday thing, and I finally realised what my friends and brothers had spent two trying to tell me -- I have strong feelings for her.

But now I don't know what to do. She's going on a date with someone she met at a pub next week, so she is open to dating. But she has mentioned in the past, indirectly rather than as an answer to a question, that she sees me like a brother. But I don't know if that's a habit of trying to deny what she feels like I have been doing, or if that really is how she feels. When we're together in person there's a definite tension, a kind of nervousness and a struggle to look each other in the eye too much. But then again she seems excited for the date, so it's quite confusing.

The only thing I can think of is that for most of the time I've known her I've said I didn't want kids, and she does. But that's starting to change for me recently, so maybe she just thinks we're incompatible for a long-term relationship. 

Do I tell her and risk losing one of my closest friendships? If so, how should I do it? Or do I just continue being her friend and hoping the feelings pass? I've been through an episode of unrequited love before, so I kind of know they won't pass, which is going to be painful. 

In short: Very close friends for two years, realised I've been denying my feelings because we were in relationships, but now we're not I'm thinking of whether to tell her about it.",t2_8jxy6lb,0,I (29M) have strong feelings for my friend (25F) and I'm not sure what to do about it,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12whl44,True,JCrago,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12whl44/i_29m_have_strong_feelings_for_my_friend_25f_and/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12whl44/i_29m_have_strong_feelings_for_my_friend_25f_and/,8847656,1682268186,0,,False,1682268204,1682268204,2023-04-23 16:43:06,,,

relationship_advice,"My husband and I (both 20s) have been dealing with a lot over the last year and in recent months we've let ourselves go.
We are a lot of junk food and basically anything to get things done quickly, you know how it can get.

Now while I am going to be taking part in this as I need to get back in shape and eat better my husband is than... cooperative? 
Basically, I go shopping and when I suggest on cutting back on specifically the junk food high in fat and aim for something healthier or just getting one bag of chips instead of 2 or 3 he'll be all pouty and say things like

""Well it's my money so I'll spend it on what I please."" 

So even when I try to lightly suggest this he immediately shuts it off.

Now the reason I'm here for advice is because he consistently makes comments about his weight and he has absolutely no confidence in his appearance. I support him and tell him I find him handsome but I think he feels it's more because we're married. But when I try to give him a solution and offer to do this with him so he will not feel isolated or alone I get pushed off. 

I don't know what to do, do I try to work something out? Do I argue? Hell do I call his mom? 😅 

I don't know what to do because I love my husband and I don't want him to think that because I'm concerned for his health I am also shaming him for his body. I married him for every part of him, and I truly do only want what will make him happy and he is miserable but he just won't take that step.

Please, any advice would be appreciated as I simply don't know how to approach this without sounding rude or anything.",t2_kzmhm46g,0,How do I (24F) get my husband (25M) to start a diet with me because he specifically is gaining weight?,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12whimy,True,Few-Meaning-9306,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12whimy/how_do_i_24f_get_my_husband_25m_to_start_a_diet/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12whimy/how_do_i_24f_get_my_husband_25m_to_start_a_diet/,8847641,1682268059,0,,False,1682268075,1682268075,2023-04-23 16:40:59,,,

relationship_advice,I 35f have been married to my 38m husband for over 15 years. I thought we were happy. Then out of no where he starts acting odd. I ask if he wanted to sleep in the spare room and have space he responds that he is just done with me. I snuck and got his phone and found he was cheating. In an attempt to get it back he busted in my car window in 3 swings. He ultimately packed his clothes and moved out. We still talk a lot over text but he's not seen me or his kids but a couple times in almost 6 months. I need to be done. Trying is killing me and making me want to die. I told him I was done and he asked me to give him a chance to fix himself but then turns around telling me that I'm nothing but a problem and I push him to much and essentially he hates me. I can't do anything right for him. I've tried. So so hard. I can't keep trying. I just don't know how to make it stop and live thru it. It'd just abusive at this point.

relationship_advice,"I (20F) totaled my boyfriends(22M) car on the 20th and, I dont know how to comfort him. 
on the site of the accident i was terrified of what he was thinking or feeling scared he was gonna leave me so i tried to be on the phone with him as little as possible. i was the one that ruined his car and everything he had been working for i thought he didnt want to be around me or hear me look at me etc.

he said he cried at work and when he got home but he brought this to my attention he said he felt isolated because when he needed me the most i was avoiding him. i didnt know he needed me,i assumed when someone does something bad to another person you leave them alone to calm down.

 i went to go see him 2 days ago finally to hug him and apologize in person and just be there for him like i should have been when i went to hug him i started crying first and i guess that made him shut down to comfort me? he was telling me that he was over it and that is was fine

 when i was on the phone with him yesterday. i mentioned im not over it and he was like me neither and, he said he lied to me cause he couldnt break down too “it would get us nowhere”. he doesnt feel like he should sit and process his emotions cause it happened and nothings gonna change what happened so emotions are just a waste of time. 

i need help. im a crier im very sensitive. how can i comfort him and let him know its okay to sit down and take his time actually processing his emotions about what happened if *I* cant stop crying. are there different approaches to where my inevitable tears wont matter?

TLDR: I crashed his car and he wont let himself process his emotions because “theres no point it wont fix anything” how can i help him process these things so its not sitting on his chest

relationship_advice,"
I (18m) have been going out with my gf (18f) for about 7 months now.
Since we got together I’ve always wanted to go on holiday with her but I had a holiday planned with my friends to play golf and go drinking first. 
Recently we’ve been arguing about her consumption of weed which I am really not fond of and after our first couple of arguments about it she booked a holiday to Amsterdam where she plans to “get violently high” with her best friend. This has made me feel like my thoughts and feelings don’t matter to her and she is going there in spite of me.
I guess I came to Reddit to vent to somebody and ask how other people would deal with this.

relationship_advice,"i give a lot of context, but u can skip to the last pargraph or so if you don't care ab it all. 

i (f21) started working at a bar a few months ago bc my friend (f22) works here.it’s on a strip of bars and the street is very tight knit. i have loved the job so far, and like the ppl other than them seeming way too up in everyone’s business. 
when i started, my friend told me one of the head cooks (m30) had a big crush on me. I trust my friend with my life and she has known him for 4 years. she trusts him like no other and told me if i ever needed anything that he would have my back.  i didn’t think much of it, and picked up weed from him a few times. i insisted to pay but he wouldn’t let me.  he ended up hanging out around me and i got to know him. i told him i wasn’t interested in anything other than being friends. we ended up hanging out at work (it’s very casual) and got our shift drinks together afterwards. he was so respectful and never ever tried to push anything or any agenda on me. he told me he was absolutely happy just having me in his life in any capacity. we have a lot in common and have very similar mindsets based on similar experiences. 
i knew my coworkers were saying things behind my back, but knew not to think anything of it because i wasn’t doing anything with him. it's important to understand why they are saying things though. he is very known in our city and has a lot of pull. he grew up running the streets and is incredibly successful financially (both in his 9-5 and personal activities). however, he is very humble and never flaunts it. he is very generous though, and our work is very tight knit, so he has been generous to many ppl, just bc that's how he is. 
he has never dated anyone during the 4 years he has been working here and according to my friend, he's had a lot of people try to use him and he has rejected a lot of advances from people here. 
well, as scary as it is, i caught feelings. he makes me feel very safe and cared for. i grew up in severe poverty at times and have learned to be content and happy being frugal.  he would try to offer me things and money early on when he saw i was struggling, but I never accepted (didn't want a power imbalance but also j feel uncomfortable accepting gifts or help). he has told me that he's never had anyone not accept when he was offering the way I do, and I genuinely believe it. i never expect anything, but as we've gotten closer I've begun accepting smaller things like him buying dinner or things like that. he really respects that i'm not using him for his status or money. 
now that we have decided to be exclusive (a hard and scary decision for me) he has already stopped dealing (which was something he has been talking about doing even before he met me) and has done a lot to show me he wants to make me feel comfortable and i truly believe he really cares about me. i know though, that a lot of girls i work with are very jealous, and everyone is shocked he wants to settle down now. i'm worried ppl we work with will think i'm a gold digger since i'm younger and he's well off, but i would be genuinely attracted to him whether he had money or not. i don't even accept what he tries to give me (when i could really use it). my bff is also crazy protective and i worry she will not approve of the age gap. the friend i work with says she fully supports us and ik there are a get ppl at work that have heard that are happy for us, and have said he's never been happier and so relaxed since they've known him. 
how do i feel confident (if i even should feel confident) letting people know we are an item? is it just because i am in a role that I know a lot of other people have wanted, or is there a good reason for them to be hating? please any advice. I know it's a risk to date someone older.

relationship_advice,"So right now I have no one to tell this story to because it’s so close to home and I need to vent somewhere.

Around a year and a bit ago I met this girl, we will call her Katie, in the shop I manage. The first time I saw her my mind was blown. She was cute, funny and just filled the room with energy. She had come to my shop with a guy a kind of knew from various gyms we both train in. 

I knew I had to talk to her someday. That night she added me on Instagram… and I’m not easy to find on Instagram. We got talking and got to know each other. She’s a little older than me (she’s now 34) and just seemed to have everything going for her. I asked her outright if she was dating the guy she came in with who was a little younger than me and she said that they just worked together. 

Over the next month or so I couldn’t get her out of my mind. We didn’t flirt heavily and nothing sexual happened but there were some signs she was interested. Before that day she came in, she’d never been in before. Suddenly she was in all the time and messaging all the time. 

But during this time I noticed she was very close with this other guy. Fastforward a few months and I questioned what was going on, in friendly manner and she denied anything was going on. I only wanted to know so I could ask her out… so I did. She never really responded with much other than “I’d love to”. 

Within the next few weeks she came in less, barely messaged, barely said hi in the gym. So I assumed I fucked up. She was just being friendly. Suddenly I hear she’s dating the other guy. So I just accepted it and carried on with life, but I knew I’d missed out. 

Over the next months she suddenly won’t even look in my direction. Yet her partner comes to my work more and more. She deleted me from Instagram… yet he follows me etc etc. I knew this wasn’t like her but; it’s not my place to say anything. So I left it.

I move on with my life and met someone incredible. The full package. A close friend of my sister that my family adored. We hit it off and instantly fell hard. Everything just fell into place. After a few months we knew we wanted to look into moving in together later this year. 

Things are going great between me and partner, a little less passionate than at the beginning but that’s normal. My partner has a son who I struggle with sometimes but life is good.

One morning I’m doing cardio in the gym and Katie walks in with a client of hers. She waves awkwardly which was confusing as she’s ignored me for almost a year…

Eventually she finishes with her client and waves again as she goes to leave. But she doesn’t, she walks her client to the door and comes and steps on the treadmill next to me. So I said hi… expecting barely a response and she starts talking to me and explains that they’ve split up.

We ended up talking about random stuff and I eventually finished and left. A few hours later she added me back on social media, to which I made a joke of messaging saying “oh you’re allowed to talk to me now you’ve split”. 

She then proceeded to send me a long message explaining everything. The guy she had dated was extremely volatile and controlled every aspect of her life. He went through her phone not long before they got together and found the message of me asking her out and he told her to never speak to me again. 

Over the next few days she basically explained a lot to me, that she knew we always had something and it always bugged her that she never took me up on the date offer and chose the wrong guy. (Mostly because it was forced upon her).

We have continued to message just typical friendly stuff but something felt odd. I missed her. I still care about her. There were still feelings. We ended up in the same gym together one evening and she asked if we could go for coffee, to which I accepted. Knowing full well I probably shouldn’t.

We sat and spoke about everything. She explained how she’d always felt like she missed a massive opportunity with me and I knew I felt the same. I of course felt like the worlds shittest human for feeling this way, and she felt horrible for telling me. 

Since finding all of this out I can feel myself losing feelings for my partner. I feel like I still love her, but not the same as I did. I feel like I care so deeply about her but more as a friend.

I know how much my partner loves me. More than anyone ever has. She’s never done me wrong. One of the hardest parts is the fact my family adore her and she will always be around my sister, which of course I would never want to change. 

I honestly don’t know what I’m doing or what I’m going to do.

I’m not even sure I want advice.

Something deep inside is telling me I might be with the wrong person. My partner deserves so much better than me.

relationship_advice,"Hi guys, I'm planning to see my therapist in a couple of weeks to discuss the subject matter but I just want to hear some outside perspective for a moment, perhaps from someone who's maybe has been in a similar situation.

I've been in a serious relationship with my partner for four years. We live together, aren't married, no kids. We met relatively young but we both dated around a lot and such and pretty quickly realized we were a good match. Overall, we've definitely had issues but we have stable communication and a loving supportive relationship. We're pretty much on the same page about various essential aspects of life as a couple, such as finances, children, etc. 

My partner has a brother with a physical disability. He is a wheelchair user that can't move to and from the wheelchair without assistance. His mental state is not impacted by anything so he has a remote job, etc. Ever since he's been born my partner's parents have been taking care of him without any extra help. It seems like they didn't ""believe"" in paying someone to help them with these ""family matters"" so that was not an option for them based on their personal values. One of their parents has passed away a couple of years ago so lately only my partner's mom was helping the brother with his daily life. Now mom is getting older and her health is also declining so my partner wants to move in his brother with us.

We do not own an apartment/a house, we both have pretty good incomes but so far we're only able to rent. My partner also doesn't feel like he can just hire a professional to come help his brother, it has to be family. He has brought up this request recently and we've discussed it thoroughly. He even said that he'll understand if I want to break up with him considering that I'm a person who loves their independence, their personal space, etc. But I really don't want to end our relationship and, at the same time, I know that it will be challenging for us to no longer have a place that's fully ours as a couple where we don't need to compromise with anyone and have another adult who needs our help there.

So far, we've agreed on a couple of things:
- We've agreed that when the brother will need to move in, we'll find a two-bedroom apartment. This was something I insisted on because I strongly believe that in order for this to work, we will need a room that's ours and a separate room for his brother + shared space where we can host friend gatherings and such 
- We've agreed that we'll try our best to prioritize each other when needed and spend time alone as a couple. That we'll still try to keep our relationship fun and adventurous, etc.
- We've agreed that we'll go to therapy if things get too challenging or we feel the need too
It seems ok but I'm honestly scared. I love him very much and I definitely get along well with his brother, I just don't know how this is going to work. Deep down, I don't want to deal with this, I just want to be a normal young-ish couple who has their space and enjoys life. But I also value him and our relationship so much, I have zero desire to break up. Any insight and opinions appreciated.

relationship_advice,"I moved from my home country at age 6, and I feel as though I’ve lived enough of a life here, I am ready to move onto the next. Without realising it, I have been tying up loose ends - paying off debts, making amends for past mistakes, forgiving those who have wronged me, etc. 

I have been with my partner for one year. Since the beginning of our relationship, I have told him that I do not want to settle here. It’s not in my plans to - never was, never will be. He met that with some enthusiasm, which was great! I thought, “Wonderful! We’ll go all over the world together.” 

He moved in September as part of a study abroad scheme and has been living in another country since, he comes back the middle of next month. This move hasn’t been a very good experience for him. He’s experienced severe loneliness and, as a result, depression and anxiety. His studies have suffered and he also hasn’t been looking after himself very well. He’s really looking forward to coming back home, as am I. I’ve missed him so much.

A few months ago, I proposed us moving back to my home country. It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a very long time, but recently it’s become even more important to me as a means of reconnecting with my roots and learning more about myself and where I come from. (I’m in therapy and I’ve realised how much immigrating has impacted me, the good and bad). He did not seem very enthused by this prospect, and made excuses as to why it wouldn’t be feasible but reluctantly said yes in the end. I asked him about this and he said he just wanted to get back to the country first. I felt this was perfectly valid, so I’ve left it for the most part. 

I feel that because he’s had such a negative experience with moving to another country, he may not want to do it again so soon after returning back to his home. Even though it will be a just over a year in between, I feel he’ll want to settle back for while before his next move. The stress of applying for visas and preparing to move also took a huge toll on his mental health. By the end of it all, he was no longer excited for his new adventure, which was really sad for me to see.

The way that I feel is that, after I graduate next Summer, it would be the perfect opportunity for me to go. The masters I’m planning to do is completely online and I have the freedom to be anywhere. I have dual citizenship and family that I can depend on back in my home country. I’ve also spoken to my parents about it and they’re very supportive and feel it will be good for me to go, and they’ll likely help me out however they can. I essentially have everything in place to go, it really won’t take that much organisation for me. 

My issue now is that I feel guilty asking him if he wants to go. I don’t have many ties here, while he has all his family and friends. I want to ask him what his plan is after he graduates this Summer, but I feel that that is a lot of pressure. Any graduates here probably know what that’s like. I think that’s where my next concern comes in. Having gone to university 5 years after leaving school, and taking this past year out to focus on my mental health, I feel I don’t have the luxury of being wishy washy with my future plans. Over the next year, I intend to make solid plans for the move, so that it’s all in motion for when I graduate. I feel this move is something that I really need to do for myself and I need to know that he’s fully on board, so that I can include him in those plans or not. 

I’m not entirely sure what my question is. I guess, how do I stop myself from feeling selfish if I leave him behind? Or, how do I not feel guilty for him moving with me, knowing deep down that he doesn’t want to? I feel that either way, it’s gonna suck. I’m not entirely sure I can do long distance again. I also know that I really am done with this current place. I guess I need some reassurance? He is the most loving and wonderful partner ever. It would break my heart to not be with him. But I also don’t want to build resentment towards him for either tainting my excitement for the move, or for keeping me here. So I know that I need to go. I also have ADHD and tend to make plans then forget about them. I feel he’s hoping that this is another one for the ADHD Graveyard. 

Tl;dr: My partner likely won’t want to move my home country with me after we graduate. I need to go for my own spiritual and personal development. How do I feel okay with leaving him behind? Or not feeling guilty, knowing deep down he doesn’t want to?",t2_vo5k8zp2,0,"I (F25) know that I want to move out of the country once I graduate next Summer, and I’m fairly sure my partner (M22) will not want to.",[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wgpcw,True,hideandsink,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wgpcw/i_f25_know_that_i_want_to_move_out_of_the_country/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wgpcw/i_f25_know_that_i_want_to_move_out_of_the_country/,8847488,1682266521,0,,False,1682266533,1682266533,2023-04-23 16:15:21,,,

relationship_advice,"A couple days ago me and my mum had a huge fight; for background info we are a very religious family (me not so much), the fight was mainly because she found out I have a boyfriend and i didn’t tell her about, she kept accusing me of doing sexual things with him, of being indecent, of trying to dress immodestly, of trying to steal her gold and the apartment she was going to buy.

I didn’t anything rude that day, it ended with her telling me I should go live with my father but we would still be on good terms and so thats what happened. I spent a day with my father then she came back for me because i wanted to avoid visiting his family and the only way was to stay at her place. 

The day i came back I was furious, i guess it took me a couple days to process my feelings and anger, she kept pushing my buttons trying to make me constantly stay next to her and trying to bring up the fight we had.

This is where I kinda fucked up, she told me she wants us to work on what happened, and that i should tell her what’s making me angry and what she does that makes me push her away etc but without being rude. I really tried to but I was very angry and kept snapping back at her until the conversation was cut short by my brother and I went to my room, where she came and brought up an irrelevant topic that came up in the conversation and made it so it is the main point and how that makes me in the wrong.

Man I was fucking angry and just screamed that I feel like i have been talking to a brick wall. She took it I am being nasty, trying to humiliate her, to hurt her, she said she cant trust me again and that if thats how i act now when I’m still living in her house how would I treat her when she is old and cripple. That i should consider her dead and that I have no mother anymore and she practically threw me out to my father’s.

I begged her for hours for her to forgive me and at least talk to me even if i live at my dad’s but she wouldn’t take it, I’ve been texting her nonstop and she is absolutely refusing to talk. I don’t know what to do? I understand i was rude and i snapped but was that really enough for her to just pretend she doesn’t have a daughter anymore? What should i do? 

Ps. Moving out and living by myself is not an option as I live in the middle east so it would be a huge problem.",t2_bcoob5aa,0,I (23F) just got kicked out after telling my mum (50F) talking to her feels like talking to a wall,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wgka4,True,fakeAccount805,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wgka4/i_23f_just_got_kicked_out_after_telling_my_mum/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wgka4/i_23f_just_got_kicked_out_after_telling_my_mum/,8847468,1682266251,0,,False,1682266266,1682266266,2023-04-23 16:10:51,,,
relationship_advice,"So the other night me my girlfriend and her friend and my friend go out to club then riding scooters downtown after , we planned on drinking so we took 1 car and decided for 1 person to be designated driver in the beginning and later another, me and “my boy” go. To my girls house to pick her and her friend up (her friend a gay dude) so her and her friend decide to sit up front since my gf would be driving while the rest of us pre gamed the entire time going to the club I noticed my “homie” being a little extra talkative and friendly with my girl like he would tell her things in Spanish and shi she would reply in Spanish back which I thought was weird cus me and her friend didn’t know any Spanish so right after that they keep talking I instantly get annoyed and keep quiet and just observe how this plays out right after the whole lil different language convo ended like 5 mins after he after her to reach under her seat n grab his gun mainly it just seemed like he was flexing it and trying to show out I still kept quiet she seemed to be entertaining his extra friendly self and she asked if I was ok because I was being quiet I replied yeah I’m straight and she just seemed to go on about her night n continue to talk and entertain my homie instead of me, once we got downtown we rode scooters and we split up for a min it was me and my boy her and her friend when we saw them they was chillin and we roll up on them and my boy playfully bumps into my girls scooter while she’s on it like 2 times and she falls over I tell him to chill out n wtf he goes my bad I didn’t mean to knock her over she’s at this point not really talking to my bro anymore we go ride scooters a lil bit we see some random guy (keep in mind it’s a college town) and he seemed chill and like a dorky kind of guy obv had some sort of social awkwardness but was cool so I some and my “boy” start talking to dude and he was cool so we ride off and come back and that guy. Is talking to my girl and she is showing him her nails I guess he asked if he could see her nails and she said yeah and placed them on top of his palm I see that tell dude to fck off n leave n dude is having a problem leaving so we get into a lil altercation my girl sees that and leaves to go get the car and when she does we all get in and go back home and on the way back to drop everyone off we get into a argument and I say she’s being weird asl and friendly and entertaining others and she gets mad starts more arguing , we get back to her house after dropping off her friend and it’s me my friend and her at her house after and I’m getting my stuff and we still arguing and she throws soda all over me so I dump a bottle of Smirnoff on her head I get all my stuff and just crash at my “boys house” since it was already like 4am at this time the next morning my friend gets her nails done by my friend (he does nails)  he tells my friend that my girlfriend wanted to tell me my friend was flirting with her but she was going to wait till next morning since she didn’t wana make the night weird she said but plans changed since we argued and alcohol and soda was thrown on each other and things were said , she forgot her atm card in my friends car that night so she added him on facebook apologize for us fighting and asked when she could get her card I didn’t find this weird but the fact my friend only said she messaged him and not friend requested him was off to me later that day I ask him what was up w that night he says he didn’t know he was flirting he was sorry but he didn’t mean anything in a flirting way , she later tells me that when I went inside to get my stuff after we were arguing my homie was all up in her face telling her it’s ok and tried to kiss her he says that never happened she says she moved away when he tried to lean in , I’m not sure what to think about to I feel like she wasn’t flirting back but entertained it , and why would she send him a friend request instead of just messaging him on fb after that supposedly happened while I was getting my stuff from her house idk what to think",t2_868nr4df,0,My best friend flirted w my girlfriend (20m and 19f),[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wgjmo,True,Consistent-Bar-270,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wgjmo/my_best_friend_flirted_w_my_girlfriend_20m_and_19f/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wgjmo/my_best_friend_flirted_w_my_girlfriend_20m_and_19f/,8847464,1682266218,0,,False,1682266235,1682266235,2023-04-23 16:10:18,,,

for context, i asked him what time do you work, i always tell him to check so i can plan accordingly, we have argued about this many times..

i myself work two jobs, i wake up most days at 4am to be at work by 5 and on weekends i work another job to make extra money, i have told him multiple times to tell me what time he works the day before so i can plan and set alarms and make sure i’m ready by the time he needs to go to work, he doesn’t tell me until the day of…

today he had to be at work by 8:30, he doesn’t tell me until 6am, i get upset bc i want to sleep in and i have to to get ready for work as well, we share one car, it’s actually my car that i own and he doesn’t help me at all with it

i told him to take an uber at 7:45 bc i was barely waking up and i still had to shower and get ready and he gets upset 

he tells me “you wake up everyday at 4 to go to work and you can’t even wake up early to take me to work” it’s not even that it’s that fact that he tells me so late idk i literally have less than an hour to get ready and make sure he’s on time, im just so tired, idk what to do, i try everything to help him the best i can with my schedule 

i work two jobs and go to school, he just works one job and i really try to do my best to help him, i somehow feel like this is all my fault, i know i should be helping him a lot more but it’s really really hard when he tells me the last minute

we’ve argued about this before and i have told him over and over again to please tell me the night before please so we can be on time and so that way i’m ready, not 2-3 hours at 5-6am before you have to go…

idk i feel like i’m in the wrong, we started to yell at each other and he ended up hitting me 3 times, now he’s late for work and will get fired and i feel like it’s all my fault

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and i have been arguing a lot the past few months. He has broken up with me last Sunday because of the constant arguing. He has continuously told me that 'his tank is empty', which i understand.
He has told me countless times that he still loves me very much and still wants me in his life. He has stressed that he wants to get back to being himself and that he needs to process everything that has happened.
He still wants to see me and spend time together and let things happen naturally.
He still treats me the same way: Says i love you, holds me, holds my hand, cuddles, sleeps with me, kisses me in public, but he has emphasized that he doesn't see this working now and that we can see where this takes us naturally while we are single but that he also doesn't want to give me false hope.

I am very in love with this person and i saw him as my future. I was willing to work on things to make things go better but he insists that we can make things right while being friends and then seeing where that goes.

I am hurt and definitely very sensitive right now, but i need some practical advice on how to act now and what to do?

relationship_advice,"I'm gonna try to explain this in as few words as possible:

I've been friends with this girl for a very long time and we are very close. We're close to the point where we've slept at each others houses before which is usually sort of awkward for guys and girls but it's never really been for us. 

Last night I had her over at my house (we started by hanging out at my house but eventually she decided to sleep over) and she brought green stuff (devil related substance). I didn't ask her too but we do this a lot so it was sort of normal. We took a few hits and started watching south park on my lap top. 

We ended up laying down and she started cuddling up to
me (we've cuddled before so again not too weird) then we stopped watching the show. While we were cuddling i started rubbing her back and playing with her hair and she eventually moved my hand across her back on onto the side of her breast. I wasn't sure if she had meant to do this so i just sort of went back to rubbing her back but then she moved my hand there again. At this point my heart was beating like crazy (not joking felt like a million beats per minute) and I started to lightly touch her breast. 

To shorten this, the next 30 or so minutes went like this:
She continued to move my hand into her chest, I continued to touch her all over, and my heart continued to beat out of my chest. Eventually I unfastened her bra and she pulled it off, and we continued like that for a bit. 

I felt that she was sort of sweaty and it was hot in my room so I asked if I should go turn down the thermostat and she said yeah. When I came back she looked super uncomfortable. I noticed this and asked if she was ok, and she asked if I could look away for a second. Understanding that she wanted to put on clothes, I left the room for a few minutes. 

When I came back she was in pajamas and may have been crying. She told me she just wants to be friends and that it was just the **stuff** and the moment. I told her that was cool and asked if she wanted me to drive her home, but she insisted on staying. I slept on the floor because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable and when I woke up we just talked for a bit and she left. 

There is definitely something off now. Ik she initiated it, but i still feel really guilty. I kind of want to do more with her now (not date but maybe friends with benefits?), but right now I'd just do anything to have things go back to normal. 

I feel like it may have been more than just the green stuff? How do I make things normal again?

Also sorry i wrote so much, I tried to make it short.",t2_9ozmcsmf,0,I (18 M) had a friend (18 F) over last night and I don't know how to get our friendship to be the same,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,nsfw,False,,[],{},,True,text,3,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,True,True,False,True,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wu32g,True,AdministrativeCod429,,1,True,promo_adult_nsfw,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wu32g/i_18_m_had_a_friend_18_f_over_last_night_and_i/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wu32g/i_18_m_had_a_friend_18_f_over_last_night_and_i/,8850032,1682291707,0,,False,1682291724,1682291724,2023-04-23 23:15:07,,,

relationship_advice,"I honestly kinda feel like I'm losing my mind. Please don't judge until you read the whole thing. 
I've been with my fiance for over 3 years now. We started dating 3 weeks before the world shut down from the pandemic in 2020, and didn't see each other for 2 months because of it. I honestly started to develop feelings for one of my close guy friends at the time, we would text almost every day, but I did tell him that I was dating someone at the time, I was just worried he was going to break up with me over quarantine since the relationship was still so new at that point. I don't remember confessing my feelings for my guy friend, or saying anything that could have been interpreted as being more than friendly. I still was texting and facetiming my fiance (new boyfriend at the time) every day, so it's not like I was ignoring him to talk to my guy friend.
Once I saw him after the quarantine period ended, our relationship got a lot more serious, and from then on, things have been very serious between us. I stopped talking to my guy friend altogether because I felt like I didn't need his reassurance about my relationship anymore, and we kinda fell out of touch. My fiance is in the military, and he has currently been deployed for over 6 months now. We still get to talk every day, but things have been hard. We have been arguing about stuff that we would never argue about if he was home. We are supposed to be moving in together in 4 months, and I am super excited about it. However, something happened that made my mind spiral, and no matter what anyone tells me, I can't convince myself that something didn't happen.
About a month ago, I found my old cell phone in my end table when I was home for spring break. I decided to plug it in and turn it on so I could read the text messages between my fiance and I from when we first started dating (since he's been gone so long, I wanted to reminisce). Well, on my old phone I found some messages between an ex and I, my guy friend and I, as well as messages between a guy I was talking to before I met my fiance. I read through them, and there was nothing questionable in the messages, but I still felt really weird about it for some reason. I used to have Snapchat at the time that I had my old phone in 2020, so I got worried that I said more to them over Snapchat that I have no way of recovering since I deleted my account in 2021. My mind started spiraling and thinking things like: ""What if I flirted with those other people while I was already in a relationship and I have no proof of it if it was over Snapchat?"" ""What if I said something to lead them on?"" ""What if I said sexual things to them and I don't remember?"" ""What if I sent them noods/explicit photos without remembering?"" ""What if I told them I had feelings for them and said I wanted to leave my boyfriend for them?"" As irrational as these thoughts sound, they started to consume me. I would have remembered doing something like that, right? I've never been a cheater, I grew up seeing my mom cheat on my dad and my stepdad, and I was always very disgusted by cheating, even small things like flirting with other people. This prompted me to reach out to these people from my past and ask if they remembered me saying anything questionable 3 years ago (which I know is a far reach), and they all said no, but couldn't 100% remember since it was so long ago. I know I can't expect them to remember everything from that long ago, but the small percentage of uncertainty did not help my anxiety at all. It made my mind spiral even more, and I literally started to wonder if I ever sent noods to any of these people, although I think they would have remembered and told me. I also am not very confident in my body, I'm a pretty modest person and it takes me a while to even send that stuff to someone I'm in a serious relationship with.
I have generalized anxiety disorder, and this whole event has definitely made it worse. I'm on medication and recently started therapy, but I feel like nothing is helping. I genuinely do not believe I would have done anything like that while in a relationship, but I feel like I can't even trust my own memory anymore. I keep telling my fiance I'm worried about it and can't get it out of my head, despite everyone else telling me ""no"" and my fiance 100% trusting me. He even got to the point where he said he wouldn't even be mad if I did any of that, as long as I didn't actually have sex with anyone (which I know for a fact I didn't), but everything else I can't say for 100% certainty, and I would feel horrible if I sent noods to other people while I was in a relationship. Is it possible that I could have done any of this without remembering until now? I feel like I would have felt extremely guilty at the time if I did, but I don't remember feeling that way at the time, none of this came into my head until I found my old phone a month ago. My fiance is worried that I'm trying to sabotage our relationship by worrying about this so much, but I really do want to marry him and spend the rest of my life with him.
I just feel lost and I have no clue what to do. Thank you for making it this far if you did 😥",t2_7ipnru0e,0,Is it possible to forget cheating on your significant other?

relationship_advice,"My girlfriend of 10 months is a really good person. She is really sweet, really loyal, and she really loves me. I am really her everything, and that is my problem.

I feel so guilty for not loving her like she loves me, and I think I will never be able to. To be honest I find her really boring, and I don’t like to spend time with her anymore. She doesn’t really have any interests, she doesn’t have any motivation to do anything, and she is so simple.

I was a really motivated guy, and I had big plans for life. But since I am with her I feel like all my motivation went away. I became comfortable. I spent the time that I spent in the gym, reading books or studying with her, and it had a lot of negative effect on me. I was a really positive guy with a lot of love, but I feel like I gave away almost all my love, and I am not happy anymore. The only time I am happy is when I am not around her. When I am with my friends or family, but without her.

Sometimes I really think I deserve someone better. And by that I mean someone I can really talk with, someone who has the same interest as me, someone who I can really love, and become succesful with. Someone with who I can finally enjoy sex too, because she wants to do it all the time, but I don’t really enjoy it anymore.

But breaking up with her is so hard. Everyone would think that I am an idiot by breaking up with her, because she is really beautiful, loves me, would do almost anything for me, and like I said, I am her everything. She even met my parents and we had already dinners with both of our parents. By the way her mom is a problem too. My family really likes her too and they wouldn’t understand why I would break up either

I just dont know what to do. I feel so bad, I feel so sick, this stress have a lot of effect on my mental and physical health. I don’t want to make her sad, but I feel like being with her will destroy me. And on the other hand I feel like if I will broke up with her, I will never find someone better, and will be the biggest regret of my life.",t2_baveyuk7,0,I (21M) dont know if I love my girlfriend (20F) anymore,[],r/relationship_advice,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.relationship_advice,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2r0cn,,12wtw0p,True,Far_Jicama7562,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wtw0p/i_21m_dont_know_if_i_love_my_girlfriend_20f/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12wtw0p/i_21m_dont_know_if_i_love_my_girlfriend_20f/,8849989,1682291323,0,,False,1682291341,1682291341,2023-04-23 23:08:43,,,

relationship_advice,"So my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year (11 months) and everything has been great so far. We get along really well we rarely fight and we have almost lots of interests in common and we even moved in together last month. Since we started dating I’ve always known he’s more conservative leaning, but the longer we’ve been together the more conservative I understand him to be. Today we were watching a show together and got into the topic of when trump was first elected as president. I said I wasn’t ever expecting him to win and bf says he actually was expecting it, and had hoped for it. I asked him why? Since in my opinion Hilary was the lesser of 2 evils but he said it was because trump fixed americas economy. For context neither live or have lived in the US it’s just a prominent topic where we are. I then asked him if trump were the leader of our country if he’d prefer that over our current PM, he said it would. I don’t know why this rattled me so much but for some reason I’ve always felt like trump was a dealbreaker sort of thing. Like in my opinion this man should never be in power for all the stuff he’s done but whatever. My bf did say he doesn’t agree with everything trump says but still emphasized he was a good president. So I guess my question is, are political differences a deal breaker?? I genuinely don’t know why this has bothered me so much and bf even said he doesn’t care that we don’t have similar political views but maybe I care???

relationship_advice,"Basically my husbands friend(30m)  in another area has recently started contacting us more and being friendly with me as well (nothing untoward) which I am enjoying. I’m a SAHM with maybe 2-3 friends of my own that don’t live nearby enough to see frequently and I know we all have lives and responsibilities. I also tend to read a lot of dark romance books to pass my time and I enjoy them. My husband reaps the benefits of particularly good books. But for some reason this friend talking to me and just existing in general has me hot and bothered and I can’t help myself but fantasizing about him almost all the time. I’ve never experienced this before and my husband and I have been together for 5 years. I thought it would go away but it’s been a couple months now and this weekend he came with his brother to visit my husband and meet our children and I thought maybe meeting him in person would kind of make me open my eyes or he’d be awful in person and I’d stop feeling this way about him. But I was wrong because if anything it made me feel things even more intensely. He’s handsome, funny, great with kids, and made an effort to sit with me and chat and get to know each other. I’m not sure if it’s because I read the books I do or if it’s that my life has become so boring and lonely or if this is just a normal thing that will go away on its own.

relationship_advice,"I was dating this guy for about 8 months, everything was going great. We had a couple of minor misunderstandings but other than that it was a good relationship, we never made it official but we spent our weekends together, and we had plans for the future. I never felt our relationship was one-sided, he told me he loved me and showed genuine interest in me. I did the same. No red flags that I can remember, no shady behaviour, and he was good at communicating things. Before he ghosted me he spent a few days in my place, this was usual and everything was as good as it gets. We didn't have any fights, he didn't seem upset, the opposite. Then he went back to his place and we made plans to hang out the following day, he cancelled cause he said he was busy at work. After that he just stopped all communication, we even had tickets for a show that same week and he didn’t show up. I sent him a text asking if he was ok, and tried to get an explanation, he read the message but never replied. After one month he replied saying he was ok and he meant to talk with me sooner. That's it, I told him I was open to talk but then he ghosted me again. It’s been 4 months and has been so hard to let go, I’ve done everything, working out, spending time with my friends, doing things that I love, working away.

relationship_advice,"I'm gonna try to explain this in as few words as possible:

I've been friends with this girl for a very long time and we are very close. We're close to the point where we've slept at each others houses before which is usually sort of awkward for guys and girls but it's never really been for us. 

Last night I had her over at my house (we started by hanging out at my house but eventually she decided to sleep over) and she brought green stuff (devil related substance). I didn't ask her too but we do this a lot so it was sort of normal. We took a few hits and started watching south park on my lap top. 

We ended up laying down and she started cuddling up to
me (we've cuddled before so again not too weird) then we stopped watching the show. While we were cuddling i started rubbing her back and playing with her hair and she eventually moved my hand across her back on onto the side of her breast. I wasn't sure if she had meant to do this so i just sort of went back to rubbing her back but then she moved my hand there again. At this point my heart was beating like crazy (not joking felt like a million beats per minute) and I started to lightly touch her breast. 

To shorten this, the next 30 or so minutes went like this:
She continued to move my hand into her chest, I continued to touch her all over, and my heart continued to beat out of my chest. Eventually I unfastened her bra and she pulled it off, and we continued like that for a bit. 

I felt that she was sort of sweaty and it was hot in my room so I asked if I should go turn down the thermostat and she said yeah. When I came back she looked super uncomfortable. I noticed this and asked if she was ok, and she asked if I could look away for a second. Understanding that she wanted to put on clothes, I left the room for a few minutes. 

When I came back she was in pajamas and may have been crying. She told me she just wants to be friends and that it was just the **stuff** and the moment. I told her that was cool and asked if she wanted me to drive her home, but she insisted on staying. I slept on the floor because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable and when I woke up we just talked for a bit and she left. 

There is definitely something off now. Ik she initiated it, but i still feel really guilty. I kind of want to do more with her now (not date but maybe friends with benefits?), but right now I'd just do anything to have things go back to normal. 

I feel like it may have been more than just the green stuff? How do I make things normal again?

relationship_advice,"I honestly kinda feel like I'm losing my mind. Please don't judge until you read the whole thing. 
I've been with my fiance for over 3 years now. We started dating 3 weeks before the world shut down from the pandemic in 2020, and didn't see each other for 2 months because of it. I honestly started to develop feelings for one of my close guy friends at the time, we would text almost every day, but I did tell him that I was dating someone at the time, I was just worried he was going to break up with me over quarantine since the relationship was still so new at that point. I don't remember confessing my feelings for my guy friend, or saying anything that could have been interpreted as being more than friendly. I still was texting and facetiming my fiance (new boyfriend at the time) every day, so it's not like I was ignoring him to talk to my guy friend.
Once I saw him after the quarantine period ended, our relationship got a lot more serious, and from then on, things have been very serious between us. I stopped talking to my guy friend altogether because I felt like I didn't need his reassurance about my relationship anymore, and we kinda fell out of touch. My fiance is in the military, and he has currently been deployed for over 6 months now. We still get to talk every day, but things have been hard. We have been arguing about stuff that we would never argue about if he was home. We are supposed to be moving in together in 4 months, and I am super excited about it. However, something happened that made my mind spiral, and no matter what anyone tells me, I can't convince myself that something didn't happen.
About a month ago, I found my old cell phone in my end table when I was home for spring break. I decided to plug it in and turn it on so I could read the text messages between my fiance and I from when we first started dating (since he's been gone so long, I wanted to reminisce). Well, on my old phone I found some messages between an ex and I, my guy friend and I, as well as messages between a guy I was talking to before I met my fiance. I read through them, and there was nothing questionable in the messages, but I still felt really weird about it for some reason. I used to have Snapchat at the time that I had my old phone in 2020, so I got worried that I said more to them over Snapchat that I have no way of recovering since I deleted my account in 2021. My mind started spiraling and thinking things like: ""What if I flirted with those other people while I was already in a relationship and I have no proof of it if it was over Snapchat?"" ""What if I said something to lead them on?"" ""What if I said sexual things to them and I don't remember?"" ""What if I sent them noods/explicit photos without remembering?"" ""What if I told them I had feelings for them and said I wanted to leave my boyfriend for them?"" As irrational as these thoughts sound, they started to consume me. I would have remembered doing something like that, right? I've never been a cheater, I grew up seeing my mom cheat on my dad and my stepdad, and I was always very disgusted by cheating, even small things like flirting with other people. This prompted me to reach out to these people from my past and ask if they remembered me saying anything questionable 3 years ago (which I know is a far reach), and they all said no, but couldn't 100% remember since it was so long ago. I know I can't expect them to remember everything from that long ago, but the small percentage of uncertainty did not help my anxiety at all. It made my mind spiral even more, and I literally started to wonder if I ever sent noods to any of these people, although I think they would have remembered and told me. I also am not very confident in my body, I'm a pretty modest person and it takes me a while to even send that stuff to someone I'm in a serious relationship with.
I have generalized anxiety disorder, and this whole event has definitely made it worse. I'm on medication and recently started therapy, but I feel like nothing is helping. I genuinely do not believe I would have done anything like that while in a relationship, but I feel like I can't even trust my own memory anymore. I keep telling my fiance I'm worried about it and can't get it out of my head, despite everyone else telling me ""no"" and my fiance 100% trusting me. He even got to the point where he said he wouldn't even be mad if I did any of that, as long as I didn't actually have sex with anyone (which I know for a fact I didn't), but everything else I can't say for 100% certainty, and I would feel horrible if I sent noods to other people while I was in a relationship. Is it possible that I could have done any of this without remembering until now? I feel like I would have felt extremely guilty at the time if I did, but I don't remember feeling that way at the time, none of this came into my head until I found my old phone a month ago. My fiance is worried that I'm trying to sabotage our relationship by worrying about this so much, but I really do want to marry him and spend the rest of my life with him.

relationship_advice,"My girlfriend of 10 months is a really good person. She is really sweet, really loyal, and she really loves me. I am really her everything, and that is my problem.

I feel so guilty for not loving her like she loves me, and I think I will never be able to. To be honest I find her really boring, and I don’t like to spend time with her anymore. She doesn’t really have any interests, she doesn’t have any motivation to do anything, and she is so simple.

I was a really motivated guy, and I had big plans for life. But since I am with her I feel like all my motivation went away. I became comfortable. I spent the time that I spent in the gym, reading books or studying with her, and it had a lot of negative effect on me. I was a really positive guy with a lot of love, but I feel like I gave away almost all my love, and I am not happy anymore. The only time I am happy is when I am not around her. When I am with my friends or family, but without her.

Sometimes I really think I deserve someone better. And by that I mean someone I can really talk with, someone who has the same interest as me, someone who I can really love, and become succesful with. Someone with who I can finally enjoy sex too, because she wants to do it all the time, but I don’t really enjoy it anymore.

But breaking up with her is so hard. Everyone would think that I am an idiot by breaking up with her, because she is really beautiful, loves me, would do almost anything for me, and like I said, I am her everything. She even met my parents and we had already dinners with both of our parents. By the way her mom is a problem too. My family really likes her too and they wouldn’t understand why I would break up either

I just dont know what to do. I feel so bad, I feel so sick, this stress have a lot of effect on my mental and physical health.

relationship_advice,"So my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year (11 months) and everything has been great so far. We get along really well we rarely fight and we have almost lots of interests in common and we even moved in together last month. Since we started dating I’ve always known he’s more conservative leaning, but the longer we’ve been together the more conservative I understand him to be. Today we were watching a show together and got into the topic of when trump was first elected as president. I said I wasn’t ever expecting him to win and bf says he actually was expecting it, and had hoped for it. I asked him why? Since in my opinion Hilary was the lesser of 2 evils but he said it was because trump fixed americas economy. For context neither live or have lived in the US it’s just a prominent topic where we are. I then asked him if trump were the leader of our country if he’d prefer that over our current PM, he said it would. I don’t know why this rattled me so much but for some reason I’ve always felt like trump was a dealbreaker sort of thing. Like in my opinion this man should never be in power for all the stuff he’s done but whatever. My bf did say he doesn’t agree with everything trump says but still emphasized he was a good president. So I guess my question is, are political differences a deal breaker??

relationship_advice,"Basically my husbands friend(30m)  in another area has recently started contacting us more and being friendly with me as well (nothing untoward) which I am enjoying. I’m a SAHM with maybe 2-3 friends of my own that don’t live nearby enough to see frequently and I know we all have lives and responsibilities. I also tend to read a lot of dark romance books to pass my time and I enjoy them. My husband reaps the benefits of particularly good books. But for some reason this friend talking to me and just existing in general has me hot and bothered and I can’t help myself but fantasizing about him almost all the time. I’ve never experienced this before and my husband and I have been together for 5 years. I thought it would go away but it’s been a couple months now and this weekend he came with his brother to visit my husband and meet our children and I thought maybe meeting him in person would kind of make me open my eyes or he’d be awful in person and I’d stop feeling this way about him. But I was wrong because if anything it made me feel things even more intensely. He’s handsome, funny, great with kids, and made an effort to sit with me and chat and get to know each other. I’m not sure if it’s because I read the books I do or if it’s that my life has become so boring and lonely or if this is just a normal thing that will go away on its own.

relationship_advice,"I was dating this guy for about 8 months, everything was going great. We had a couple of minor misunderstandings but other than that it was a good relationship, we never made it official but we spent our weekends together, and we had plans for the future. I never felt our relationship was one-sided, he told me he loved me and showed genuine interest in me. I did the same. No red flags that I can remember, no shady behaviour, and he was good at communicating things. Before he ghosted me he spent a few days in my place, this was usual and everything was as good as it gets. We didn't have any fights, he didn't seem upset, the opposite. Then he went back to his place and we made plans to hang out the following day, he cancelled cause he said he was busy at work. After that he just stopped all communication, we even had tickets for a show that same week and he didn’t show up. I sent him a text asking if he was ok, and tried to get an explanation, he read the message but never replied. After one month he replied saying he was ok and he meant to talk with me sooner. That's it, I told him I was open to talk but then he ghosted me again. It’s been 4 months and has been so hard to let go, I’ve done everything, working out, spending time with my friends, doing things that I love, working away. I just stayed away cause what else are you gonna do, but I feel that hasn’t worked out for me. Should I reach out after all this time?

relationship_advice,"So my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year (11 months) and everything has been great so far. We get along really well we rarely fight and we have almost lots of interests in common and we even moved in together last month. Since we started dating I’ve always known he’s more conservative leaning, but the longer we’ve been together the more conservative I understand him to be. Today we were watching a show together and got into the topic of when trump was first elected as president. I said I wasn’t ever expecting him to win and bf says he actually was expecting it, and had hoped for it. I asked him why? Since in my opinion Hilary was the lesser of 2 evils but he said it was because trump fixed americas economy. For context neither live or have lived in the US it’s just a prominent topic where we are. I then asked him if trump were the leader of our country if he’d prefer that over our current PM, he said it would. I don’t know why this rattled me so much but for some reason I’ve always felt like trump was a dealbreaker sort of thing. Like in my opinion this man should never be in power for all the stuff he’s done but whatever. My bf did say he doesn’t agree with everything trump says but still emphasized he was a good president. So I guess my question is, are political differences a deal breaker?? I genuinely don’t know why this has bothered me so much and bf even said he doesn’t care that we don’t have similar political views but maybe I care???

relationship_advice,"Basically my husbands friend(30m)  in another area has recently started contacting us more and being friendly with me as well (nothing untoward) which I am enjoying. I’m a SAHM with maybe 2-3 friends of my own that don’t live nearby enough to see frequently and I know we all have lives and responsibilities. I also tend to read a lot of dark romance books to pass my time and I enjoy them. My husband reaps the benefits of particularly good books. But for some reason this friend talking to me and just existing in general has me hot and bothered and I can’t help myself but fantasizing about him almost all the time. I’ve never experienced this before and my husband and I have been together for 5 years. I thought it would go away but it’s been a couple months now and this weekend he came with his brother to visit my husband and meet our children and I thought maybe meeting him in person would kind of make me open my eyes or he’d be awful in person and I’d stop feeling this way about him. But I was wrong because if anything it made me feel things even more intensely. He’s handsome, funny, great with kids, and made an effort to sit with me and chat and get to know each other. I’m not sure if it’s because I read the books I do or if it’s that my life has become so boring and lonely or if this is just a normal thing that will go away on its own. Sorry for the long rambling post I guess I just had to get this out. I’m not sure where to go from here if I even say anything to my husband or just keep it to myself.

relationship_advice,"I was dating this guy for about 8 months, everything was going great. We had a couple of minor misunderstandings but other than that it was a good relationship, we never made it official but we spent our weekends together, and we had plans for the future. I never felt our relationship was one-sided, he told me he loved me and showed genuine interest in me. I did the same. No red flags that I can remember, no shady behaviour, and he was good at communicating things. Before he ghosted me he spent a few days in my place, this was usual and everything was as good as it gets. We didn't have any fights, he didn't seem upset, the opposite. Then he went back to his place and we made plans to hang out the following day, he cancelled cause he said he was busy at work. After that he just stopped all communication, we even had tickets for a show that same week and he didn’t show up. I sent him a text asking if he was ok, and tried to get an explanation, he read the message but never replied. After one month he replied saying he was ok and he meant to talk with me sooner. That's it, I told him I was open to talk but then he ghosted me again. It’s been 4 months and has been so hard to let go, I’ve done everything, working out, spending time with my friends, doing things that I love, working away. I just stayed away cause what else are you gonna do, but I feel that hasn’t worked out for me. Should I reach out after all this time?
