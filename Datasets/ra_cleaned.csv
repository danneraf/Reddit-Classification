relationship_advice,"TLDR: My mother wants me to go no contact with aunt and a group she is in, but I don't know if I shozld follow her, because she is also toxic.

My mother today and yesterday told me that she thinks that her sister banged (probably) with my mothers ex of years, which ended due to him not respecting her mostly. 

After that she started telling me how her sister is just a princess and is a self observed person and told me stuff about what she ahd done to her. If you are familiar with narcissists family systems, then my aunt is the golden child and my mother is the scapegoat (more in childhood) for my grandmother who is a narc. This is what my mother tells. She wants me to go no contact with her after my finals and leave my yoga group in which my aunt introduced me and whose member I really got close to. 

I would normally do this, but I have doubts for multiple reasons:

I just went no contact with my father, sister and their part of the family 2 years ago, because of abuse and I started therapy after that and I learned that while my father was a narcissist (diagnosed a few years before that), my mother has BPD (diagnosed a few years before that). My aunt invited me to that group and that was the first place where I felt like I'm respected and that people just wait me there and want me there. I actually grew close also to my aunt too, I sometimes even thought about moving to my aunt, because my mom does really toxic stuff every week or every 2 weeks. 

If what my mother says about my aunt is true than my aunt is a narcissist too and overall self observed and toxic, but I don't know if I can believe that. I didn't really had any friends for years and when I got a few this year my mother also when heard that started saying how they will betray me and if they fo something she starts to create a narrative about how they will use me, for example: a friend and I agreed to go to the cinema, but an hour before that he told me that he has to cancel, because he got ill and that he is sorry for telling this late, but he wanted to wait for last second to see if he gets better. My mother when heard this told me that he will use me and wants to take my money and he will leave me when he won't need me anymore. She does this with every person in my life. 

Honestly I think that she will want me to go no contact with my grandmother too in the future and by then she will be completely alone. I just don't know what to do. She has trust issues and doesn't want any psychologists and she told me that this is why we are here to basically be her psychologists. In fact we rarely speak and when we do it is about her telling how bad her life is, who is the trash person and stuff like that. She doesn't respect what we wants, if it isn't something she like. My school psychologist told me that I should visit a psychotherapist, because of my traumas, but my mom refuses to do it, because psychologist only wants our money and it wull make me even stupider. She also emotional blacmail me for years to not work in the summer. 

Now I decided to work this summer and also I made an appointment to a psychiatrist, but my mother doesn't know about this and I don't know if I did the right thing. 

So I don't know what to do: follow my mother and go no contact with my aunt and the group or just don't and keep in contact. I don't know if I can trust her and even what she says is true, she isn't better really and she is someone who always puts me in her fights with everyone and overall doesn't really care about my needs.",0,My mom (48f) wants me (18m) to cut contact with aunt (54f) and other people,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8871627,1682548515,0,1682548528,1682548529,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,15,700

relationship_advice,"My mother is extremely overbearing and involved with my life. She is very emotional and sort of manipulative. She tries to meddle in every facet of my life. She wants me to get married but the woman should be of her choice entirely ie one she can hangout with and who likes her more than me. Constantly guilts me about not providing her grandchildren. Bemoans my career choices and tries to meddle in my personal life.

Recently she visited me for 2 weeks. I was supposed to drop her back to her house tomorrow. Today she called up my dad and told her about it. He asked her to stay back because the house they live in is being renovated and he wants her to stay back because of the dust for a few more days. This lead to chaos in my life because i already had plans to see my girl who is visiting me for the weekend. I don't want to introduce my gf to her because she's divorced and knowing my mom she may ask out of turn questions and possibly judge her. 

Now we had plans for my mom to go back tomorrow but she  refused because my dad insists that she stay back due to the dust in the house etc (reality-because he is enjoying the house to himself). He's insisting that she stay until Sunday atleast. This lead to enormous drama with me because all my plans fell apart because of this and now she's refusing to go because my dad said no. No matter how much i try to convince her she's insisting she would stay 2 more days. She keeps asking me if she should take a hotel for 2 days because I don't want her in my house. I don't want it to go that far.

My dad was a highly paid executive and led a colourful life. He's very protective about his money too. He has retired a couple of months ago and secretly detests living with my mom due to her nature of bemoaning and complaining all the time about how unsatisfied she is even though she has practically every thing a person can want. She's a very unhappy woman who spends a lot of money that she didn't earn and still finds ways to complain.

Yesterday I told her that my friends wanted to party and they decided to wait until she leaves so as to not inconvenience her . This lead to huge drama in my apartment. With lots of crying and complaining.

She told me that she feels very possessive about me and doesn't like that i exclude her from my social circle. Like wtf she's 60 and i am 32. She told me she used to feel very possessive about my dad to and that lead to huge fights between them when i was young. She even feels possessive when i 'we' talk to men or hangout with men. She wants to hangout with us all the time (not to mention she has her own group of friends that i don't associate with)

When i was young she would not let me date women and now she doesnt like the kind of women i date. She wants a stay at home wife for me who hangs out with her and they go shopping etc.

Frankly i tried explaining to her that i am 32 yr old adult and i need my privacy but she gets all emotional and manipulative.

I don't want it things to go too bad between us.

My 23(f) ex boyfriend 24(m) dumped me over text about a week and a half ago. We had been going through issues in our relationship for some time. I wanted to do everything to make it work. I have been in therapy almost our entire relationship working on myself, and talking to her about relationship issues. 
During the text thread that ended in the breakup I asked ex bf what he would do you actively work through his issues. Throughout our relationship it was always promises of being better with no discernible change. I asked him what he would actively do to change that. I asked him if he would go to therapy, he said no. So I asked him again what he would actively do to help better himself. I was met with texts from him that were cruel to me. I knew this was him being defensive. I just wanted to feel like I wasn’t the only one working on the relationship. Then he sent the breakup text. Immediately my best friend and I went to his place (he was out of town) dropped off his things and collected mine. I didn’t do anything petty. I did however miss some of his things and he still has things of mine. I responded to his message days later with my feelings of hurt. He ended a year and a half relationship over text. The worst part is he blames me for that. He went back and emphasized texts that said “If you’re done just tell me” and “if you’re going to breakup with me just do it”. I know that does not paint me in a good light. I said those things hours before the breakup and in response to him saying hurtful things. 
Now because I don’t want to go back and forth with blame I suggested we focus on getting each other the rest of our things. We are seeing each other on Friday because he has things to say to me. I wrote all of my feelings down in a letter for him. I’m going to hear what he has to say and give him my letter. I still love him despite everything. I just want to know how to heal from a loss like this.

relationship_advice,"TLDR: I practically ran away from I guy I really liked because of my social anxiety. Now I can't stop thinking about him.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a book promotion in my local bookshop a few days ago. There, I saw a guy who's completely my type - looks, behaviour and all. It seems like he was interested in me too, as we locked eyes a few times. When the event was over, we lingered close to each other and I think he was literally walking towards me, we were looking at eachother and it felt like he was about to approach me.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of my social anxiety I panicked for a bit and literally went down a flight of stairs. When I turned around, I saw that he kinda made a half turn after I went down and stayed on the top floor.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is these things never happen to me. I never notice people that I don't know, and I never develop crushes for strangers. And I especially don't think that everyone wants to meet me etc. This is literally the only time something like this has happened to me, so it's a sole situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I found his Facebook, but it'd be really creepy to add him since I shouldn't know anything about him, we don't have any mutual friends etc. I wish I wasn't so stupid, and as time passes I'm overthinking if he even was interested in the first place.

relationship_advice,"We've known each other for about a year and a half now, and I've had a crush on him for most of it. I wasn't just waiting around for him, though - I was happy just being his friend. We've got a lot of experiences in common and a similar sense of humor. Over the past couple of months, we've started talking and hanging out more, and he told me recently that I'm one of his closest friends (he is also one of mine). Since then, it's been getting harder to ignore my feelings.

He's not quite conventionally attractive but he's incredibly charismatic, so a lot of really pretty girls are interested in him. Obviously, since I have feelings for him, this makes me jealous. I hate it. Not only is it painful, but I feel guilty for being possessive over someone who doesn't owe me any sort of reciprocation. Even if he did like me back (he doesn't), I'm not ready for a relationship. He deserves someone who can actually commit.

Next week, I'm supposed to go camping with him and a group of other people - One of which is a girl he's kind of dating, and another of which he used to have a huge crush on. This will be my first time meeting them, and the longest stretch of time I've spent around him.

How do I get over him without distancing myself/ruining the friendship? I want to be able to enjoy the trip, but I'm worried I'll make myself miserable and be awkward.

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I are taking time apart, should I get back together with him

This is going to need a lot of background information so bare with me. 
My ex (m20) and I (f20) had been together for over a year and like other relationships we had our ups and downs. However, for a few months before our break up I noticed he was being really protective over his phone. I asked him about it once and he said it was because his grandpa was dying and there was a lot of personal messages going on at the time and he was embarrassed for me to see. Which I understood and dropped it. However, time has gone on and he was still weird about his phone. I have a couple examples: 1. He was trying to get his Spotify to work while he was driving and was swerving a bit so I offered to try and fix it for him. He refused and once I demanded his phone he handed it over but continued to swerve bc he had to look at what I was doing on his phone. 2. He wanted to show me a YouTube video and asked to use my phone when he was already on YouTube so I pressed and said let’s just use your phone. He gave in but not without a bit of a fight and then out his phone in “do not disturb” because he hates when notifications pop up. That’s when red flags started going off. So I brought it up to him the next day and he eventually gave in, saying he has been watching porn. To preface he used to say porn disgusted him and he never watched it so I thought there was a precedent that watching porn is cheating: also since he said one of his fraternity brothers was asking if being subscribed to an only fans or watching porn is cheating and he said yes. When he told me I was caught off guard and felt lied and betrayed since he had been lying to me about what was really going on. He has bad anxiety and said that watching porn and rubbing one out quickly helped get rid of it. That it was a quick fix. Basically saying he has a porn addiction. In that moment I asked him if there was anything else about our relationship good or bad or about me or him good or bad to tell me. He didn’t. After that I felt like he’d been honest with me and our relationship was really good. Then one night I had an urge to look through his phone, I know bad but I had a gut feeling. After he said he’d stop watching porn since I considered it cheating, not only a week after that first conversation he had watched porn again. This was something I could get past as he was clearly struggling with it but I still felt betrayed. I found in his recently deleted pictures of girls little waists from VSCO. I also found a screenshot of tinder in his messages from a date before we had that conversation and while I was in Florida for spring break. I woke him up and he denied it at first. Then I broke him and he said he doesn’t remember screen shotting that profile that said, “looking for short term fun” with her instagram in the bio. But that he did have it but just to look and see if he felt something. He said he didn’t and all he wants is me he also showed his account because I forced him to download it again and it was anonymous under a different name and no pictures. We took a break then next day and talked again and I was fully prepared to break up with him and I did. He said that he knows he did me wrong and he’s not trying to excuse or defend his actions. That he had done research and saw that people with porn addictions tend to want to do something risky. He said I fought for you at the beginning of our relationship (because it took me awhile to want to date) and that even if we take time apart now (he refuses to use the words break up) that he could fix his issues and get the help he needs. He said that he would fight to be in a relationship with me once he deals with his issues until I tell him to stop. We have been meeting in sundays so I can see his progress and really right now his progress is that his mental health is getting better because by me being gone he’s forced to face his emotions instead of use me as a blanket to feel better. That he doesn’t think this time apart should take as long as he thought and that he wants to be with me. I can’t help but wonder if he’s taking this time apart to just hang out with his friends and go out and be single and have me to fall back on. I don’t want to be the girl that looks like a fool but I also know that I love him and I know he loves me and I can see a future with him. It’s just hard to completely trust him and wonder what he’s doing since I’m not in the picture right now. I know him as a person and I know he didn’t want to hurt me and that he does want to be with me. Besides what had been going in recently we are an amazing match.

relationship_advice,"Back in January, I messaged SILs and MIL:

**Hello. We hope you’re all doing well.**

**SO and I are setting our very minimal travel plans for this year. We can go out-of-state for spring break, March 11-18. We’re also flexible during summer break between May 26 and August 10, except the end of June. We will stay local on Thanksgiving and year-end holidays.**

**Let us know how your schedule looks and when you are free to hang out.**

I received no response from anybody. Context: I’ve been in the US for 14 years. I’m not sure if this is a language or etiquette issue and I’m actually an ass.

Background: We meet my husband’s side of the family once a year. Back then, SO and I only had one kid, the youngest grandchild, while SILs have five kids between them, that’s why we always had to fly to either MIL’s house or SILs’ house to see them once a year. They’re all on the East Coast. This has been going on for the last 14 years. They have never flown to visit us.

Now, their youngest kid is already 10 years old, while we have two toddlers at home aside from the eldest, so I thought it’s my turn to let them know our availability and see where they’re at and maybe they can do the adjusting this time around.

relationship_advice,"So for some background on the relationship we were together for a year and 6 months and we were both each other's first actual healthy relationship and I was her first 2 weeks have passed since the relationship ended and it was I who ended things and I tried to talk things out at the end but she's been preparing for it and had claimed that she didn't see me romantically anymore, it was understandable and the state that I was in to be honest but since then I've changed. I've started going to the gym, learning how to cook, I workout when I wake up, make myself something to eat , whereas before I really didn't do anything for myself as I didn't care for myself , my entire lifestyle has changed into a more healthy one needless to say, I've even started learning her native language, Spanish and I'm attempting to make a song on piano and both Spanish and English since I play. She says that she isn't really interested in relationships at the moment and doesn't know when she will be and that she doesn't want me to wait for her to be. Yesterday I had made Croquettes out of a cookbook that I bought recently and I brought her some on her break and we talked about some stuff and music and such and we just had a good time lots of smiles lots of laughs there was touching Etc. After she left I'd almost forgotten to give her the croquettes and she reminded me and she started skipping away, it looked like a good sign. Today a mutual and I visited her on their break and bought her boba and I brought the manga that she'd been interested in that I had and some pads as she's coming up on her period. She forgot the pads and I was actually making another recipe from The cookbook later on that night and I made her some dinner from it, I brought her before she got off of work and we ate some together and she was upset about something and she was okay with me giving her a hug, and we talked some more as she calm down and she said something about being close friends and platonic as I hugged her and wrapped my arm around her, she posed the question that what if I'd lost feelings for her as I waited, what if she met somebody and I hated her for it, what if she was never ready and I was left holding on to this false hope Etc. Both of these days she has expressed that I've made her day better by coming and visiting her on her break, even the other night we were on the phone and that asked her if she was fine with sleeping on call and if she'd rather me in the call and she said she was didn't mind regardless. I guess my question to you you all is what do you guys think? Do I have a shot?

relationship_advice,"(M24) Little back story, I’ve been going out with my gf (F22) kinda off and on again for almost 5 years. The main reason I broke it off the first 2 time were selfish reasons and me listening to other and not myself or how I felt about her. The first time I broke it off about 2 1/2 years in which lasted about a week apart then got back together. Then about a 1 1/2 years later I broke it up again because I was listening to others about my relationship and not actually thinking about it which I regret doing. And then lasted about 2 months before coming back. Which during the whole time battled an addiction to porn but then after the second break up killed the addiction and have been clean ever since. But after the second time I broke up I was happy for about a month but still kept thinking about her and then started just crying a lot and being mad at myself about the whole thing then that happens over month 2. Then also through month 2 she told me she started just talking to another guy which just kinda flipped a switch in my head about me and her relationship. I didn’t know about the other guy until the end of month 2. I didn’t know the whole month about it. But made me realize what all I was pretty much throwing away by me listening to other and putting 100% in to the relationship when I was lazy before. Fast forward to today where we are back together again and I can’t be happier since I’ve been putting in my effort and we have thought about the future. But thought the last 2 months together she is still speaking to the guy she was talking to before. She has never done anything to me in terms of cheating or doing anything that would make me question anything about our relationship. Which it make me a little uncomfortable that they are still talking. But I can also kinda understand that maybe she thinks I’ll break up again and maybe she doesn’t want to loose that connection with that guy. But idk. I have asked he about it and she said they are just friends and I’ve said I’ve accepted it and trust her. I just dk if I should worry about anything or at least let her know it makes me uncomfortable. It just makes me think I’m not enough attention for her since she’s still talking to him. I know she wants me to propose in July, which I would but don’t have the finances to do that then so I told her it might be later than that. But I do want to propose to her. Which I know she has told me I could ask her then wait a year or 2 to get married, she has just told me that she wants the essential guarantee that I won’t break her heart again. What do you guys think? Do you think I should let her know it make me uncomfortable?

relationship_advice,"Cant really sum this up so get ready for a lot of reading if you’re interested. Also I apologize for no mobile formatting. The notes app to Reddit copy didn’t work as I hoped. This was written 2 days ago as well. When I mention “today” it was at the time I wrote it.
Today in a fit of rage, I accused my girlfriend and our (her) friend of cheating. She’s been spending quite some time with him alone until late into the night. Since this has been occurring more often, our sex life has gone from fiery and exciting to non existent. When she comes over she just falls asleep and we haven’t been doing anything. I mentioned this and she said she’s been tired. I replied by saying I’m tired from work too but still want to do things. She said she deals with things differently. Understandable. I’ve had some concerns about their friendship but didn’t want to jump to conclusions at first. I discussed with my girlfriend what I thought which was that she let me know when she’s home, that we spend more time together instead of her going to her friends, and that we do more things together. For context, she always makes plans with him or is on the phone with him when I call her after work to make plans. When I discuss us doing something or have a date planned she says she had just made plans moments ago to go hang out at his house. Sometimes there are more people there and sometimes I’m invited (by him btw this made me trust their word yet I let emotions and doubt overcome me) but a lot of the time, it’s just them two. I was talking to my brother about it and he found it really strange, said I should discuss it directly with her or “If I were you I’d just leave, that’s strange behaviour. Find a girl that respects you and your wants/needs”. I took it with a grain of salt because he’s a little too controlling in his relationship. But that’s for him to figure out not me. He he’d be pissed off cause it definitely sounds like she’s cheating. I have no evidence and I do believe she’s been loyal. I tend to look up to my brother so without thinking, I called her friend and got pissed and threw threats his way and he mine and I was fuming. I barely remember much it was such a spur of the moment, impulsive and emotional decision. Ive never done something like this before. I didn’t and don’t even mean anything I said. I then called my girlfriend and said we might be done. That I can’t completely trust her or her friend that she hangs out with. I then brought up my previous points and the fact she avoids it when I’ve brought it up (only once) in the past. I said I need some time to clear my head and then we can talk when she’s ready to. We talked later that day and I’ll get back to that. I talked to her friend and we’re both cool now but he told me something that he said never to bring up around her. Basically saying she had intentions to sleep with him. They’ve slept in the same bed together but platonically. He’s done it with his guy friends too and they’re all straight so I don’t think that’s significant. It’s weird because when I told her she denied it and got angry with her friend. She then said he was the one that was attracted to her. He said she said type of thing. At this point in time I believe my girlfriend. I know she wouldn’t lie though because she’s been honest about the mutual friend sleeping with her and telling me (before I knew them) Anyway, when I apologized for crying and accusing her of cheating, her reaction was also strange. Instead of reacting as she normally would, she got angry with me. I would expect her to be hurt that I suggested such a thing (even though I wish her no harm) I was out of line for throwing it out there but so many instances and evidence lined up in the state of mind I was in. When I asked her to provide examples she never could. As I was saying, she got angry said she was furious with me and said we both need to take a break. It also seems when I want to talk about a concern such as maybe we should go on more dates instead of staying at home and sleeping, an argument is somehow started and it’s my fault. There are so many issues that both of us need to work on. Besides these last couple weeks everything has been fine. I’m only highlighting the bad but every other aspect has been perfect otherwise. When talking to her in person, she said she needs some time to de-stress from life and we both need time to focus on what we want and to work on our own issues separately. She also believes that our values, perspectives, and political beliefs are too different for us to work. She’ll be going to school by this fall (if she applies and gets accepted) so we both knew it would be short term that would possible turn into long-ish distance. Only an hour drive. That was more my thought because I became invested in her quickly. This has only been a 3 month relationship. I just really realized the feelings I have for her and I was unsure if she had them for me as well. I’ve been in a few relationships in the past longer term but I love this girl like no other. I’ve been single for a lot of time too and it is nice and I only got into a relationship with her because of how we are together. I’ve never been so attracted to someone’s personality and beauty like hers. Her music taste, her hobbies, the way we literally think the same and say things at the same time (more than what would be normal lol), Being in her presence and her in mine brings me peace. We get along with each others family. She’s incredible. Amazing. Again, unlike anyone I’ve ever met. And my own personal problems interfered with our relationship. She did nothing wrong. This is my biggest regret and I’ve done some stupid things in my life. I want to send her a text and tell her how I feel but I don’t know if it’s too soon. This was a major wake up call for me. I hope she realizes this and is willing to come back. I want to be a part of her life through her growth and accomplishments her to be a part of my life as I grow and have accomplishments.

relationship_advice,"I am currently struggling with my feelings for my close friend. I've been friends with her since we were in nursery school, but we only really became close after we turned 16. We occasionally talked back then, but nothing too serious. However, after my recent breakup, we started talking more and more. We texted regularly and even talked on the phone quite frequently. As we talked more, I started to realize that I had feelings for her.

I started flirting with her, and I thought that she was flirting back. After a couple of months, I decided to take the plunge and propose to her over text. The next day, she replied and turned me down politely. She said that she couldn't give me any hope because her parents were really strict and wouldn't allow her to talk to me on the phone or go out with me. I knew her parents were strict, but I had no idea that they were that strict. They wouldn't even let her come to my birthday party, which was only 15km away from her home in the middle of the afternoon.

After she turned me down, she acted like everything was normal and initiated conversations with me daily. We still talked, and we even hung out occasionally. I even dated another girl for a few weeks, and I told her about it because I considered her to be one of my closest friends. I thought I had moved on, but something changed when I broke a promise to her. I promised her that I wouldn't tell anyone something, but I ended up telling someone anyways. When I told her what happened, she became really sad and started crying. She told me that I was the only male friend she trusted and that I had let her down. I felt terrible, and I knew I had to make it up to her.

The next day, I went to her college (which was 20km away) and picked her up. We went for a drive, and I got her some ice cream and snacks. Seeing her happy made me feel really good, but it also made me realize that my feelings for her were still there. I don't know what it was about that day, but something changed. After a few weeks we had a school reunion, but I couldn't make it for some reason. She asked me to go with her multiple times, and she was really sad when I couldn't make it.

relationship_advice,"It’s hard to even know where to start, but the short version is that over the past 13 years my sister (37F) has continued to make allegations that our dad (69M) abused her when we were kids. She has had some mental health issues over the years and when she first brought things up to me it was shortly before she got married so I chalked it up to her having wedding anxiety (she brought up a lot of other things unrelated to my dad, like questioning if she was maybe a lesbian, etc)

Things she has claimed…
She once walked in on him looking at porn. He was in his office with the door shut and she walked in without knocking. It was pretty generic porn but it was horrified and it never happened again. More recently she claimed he would show her things on his computer in an attempt to groom her so we think it came from this originally? 

We had a 1.5 bathroom house so we shared 1 shower between the 4 of us which occasionally made mornings tricky. We had a frosted glass shower door so you could sort of see the person in the shower so we mostly tried to avoid going in the bathroom when someone else was showering. She said this was inappropriate, my parents should have built another shower or gotten a different kind of shower door that was not see through. Most recently she escalated this claim to say my dad would walk in on her while she was showering to watch her.

When we were little (maybe like 5 or 6) if my dad came home in winter and his hands were cold he would sometimes put them on our stomachs to “warm them up” as a joke. It was playful and just meant to tease us. He did this to me as well until and I never remember it being weird, just a silly thing I did with my dad. She now says my dad did this so he could grope us

My sister maintained a normal relationship with my dad over the years and he never knew about these claims until many years later when I eventually told my mom who told him. He and my mom helped her through her divorce (both financially and emotionally) and had good relationships with her two kids. When he found out about the things he said he immediately denied them and was crushed by the accusations. She has back pedaled over the years and apologized to him, but it seems like whenever things are going bad in her life (during her divorce, Covid, etc) she comes back to this accusations and lashes out at my dad as the source of all of her problems. My dad has been adamant that none of this is real, and that he never intentionally tried to make my sister uncomfortable. I have always believed him, as has my mom. It has finally gotten to the point where my mom and I are cutting ties with my sister in solidarity with my dad. I’m just really struggling to understand why she is doing this. More recently she had implied she was seeing a therapist at the time she first made the allegations who helped plant these ideas in her head. 

Has anyone been in this situation with a family member? Did they ever come to their senses?  Is it possible she truly believes these things or is she doing all of this in malice?

relationship_advice,"My girlfriend broke up with me about a month ago. In the relationship I was basically at my lowest point in recent years. She would always brush me off in public and talk to other guys in front of me. She would make me wait very long in between texts just for her to say ok and not talk to me. All of it conditioned me to be stressed about speaking to her. And I blamed myself for all the wrong ways she treated me, thinking I did something wrong. She tanked my self confidence, it honestly feels like she just used me for the love I gave her and then got bored. The more I did for her the more she took. We could only see each-other on the weekends due to work, and she never wanted to go on proper dates. It was always the same cycle of watch a movie and then sleep together every weekend. And I lived for those weekends when it felt like she loved me. I feel manipulated but I also feel like she didn’t mean to do this. She only insulted me a few times but those few times really changed me, for instance she told me that my hair cut looked like shit and that I should shave off. So I shaved it for that bitch.

relationship_advice,"So I'll start off with what happened and then I'll give more info.

I typically plug my phone in for my bf because he forgets to all the time. So, when I do, there occasion we're it'll light up and show a bunch of notifications. Ok whatever.

But I had seen a while ago,( I want to say a week maybe but I could be wrong I didn't jot it down or anyrhing?) Where I had seen a bunch of notifications on in my bfs Instagram from a profile I'd never seen before. My bf is very, well, he doesn't really make friends easy. He would always tell me , I don't want to make friends at work I don't care about those people, which is valid cause some  people at his job are rude as hell. 

So I had seen these and was like, hm, weird. Maybe a day later I had asked my bf to send me a funny video we were both watching and I saw that same Instagram account pop up under his like, most recent or most talked to or whatever it is.
So it made me feel weird again. I look up the account and I've heard hide nor tail of this person, a very pretty lady. I saw her notifs come up more than once on his phone.

Before we left so I could take him to work (he has PTSD from getting hit by a car so I drive) I asked if I could see his saved insta reels so I could send myself some of the recipes he'd shown me. He quickly replied ""no"" and then when I held his phone for a lil bit in confusion he kind of like took it back from me when he though I just kept going into his stuff?

Which made me feel really fucking weird. I kind of retreated into myself, where I try to feel ok or think it though but ultimately I become a little quiet or distant. I wasn't rude to him or anything, but you could tell I had something on my mind.

(So in the past he had a friend I was a bit uncomfortable with because he would message her a lot, he'd never met her, and I confronted him badly about it(I was about passive aggressive with a dash more aggressive). He let me see the messages before, and I remember it being like fine. It was fine they were just talking. Iirc this topic kind of came up twice, one time I looked the other time I didn't.)

Learning from my mistake, I tried to very calmly and rationally ask about his new(?) friend. 

The conversation goes something like this but now down to the detail (and maybe slightly out of order:

Us driving to his work
Me: hey, is there like.... Anything I need to worry about?

Him: what do you mean

Me: I mean like... Is there anything I need to be worried about. Like is there anyone I need to be worried about?
(This maybe wasn't the best way to go about it in hind sight but I'm fucking trying man.)

then I kind of explain what happened with the notifications and charging phone

Him (getting kind of irritated): We just became friend like three days ago. 

Me: you met her and followed her three days ago?
(Which I think is kind of a lie only because he liked a picture from the beginning of the month(it wasn't of her but it was well over 3 days before this. My bf doesn't like shit on insta. Shit he doesn't even like some of my pictures. My bf just isn't the person to add someone on insta gram the day he meets them. Chatting them up immediately. My bf probably wouldn't talk to any of you upon first meeting you.)

Him: yeah (digs out his phone from his pocket and put it on the center console while I'm driving) if you want to look at the conversation you can.

Me: no dude I don't want to go through your phone, (I kind of did but I was driving, and I just wanted to talk to him about it) I just want you to talk to me if you make friends so I know? Like, I see a bunch of notifications pop up from an account I've never seen before, I look her up and she's very pretty, and you've never mentioned her. What am I supposed to do?


So we got into a kind of argument, me basically trying to explain to him that I don't care if he has work friends I WANT him to have work friend,, but I want to be let known about them at least. At one point I had to point out that I'm his gf and I want to know stuff like this??
He was getting irritated cause he feels like I never trust him. 

Which I do and I don't. (We had a conversation about trust a while ago, from the other chick, he at one point asked me why I couldnt trust him and I asked him if he knew our anniversary. I asked if he even knew my birthday. He could answer either of those questions. I asked him how I could have full trust in him if he can't even remember my birthday.

We've been dating/living together for almost 2 years now. (Yes it was a bit fast) 
We live together, but he's never told me he loves me.
I've told it to him (too early before I'll admit) but I said it again when it felt we were really good and...nothing.
He's very cuddly affectionate with me, but we haven't had sex in.... Over a month? And our sex life before the new apartment would maybe be once a month?
I asked him to join me in the shower about a week ago and I waited for almost an hr before I just gave up and cleaned myself. He checked in on me but it was cause I was in there for so long. (I brought both of these point up in our conversation)

I asked him if he'd find it weird if there was like 9 notifs on my phone from someone he doesn't know and he said he wouldn't care, because he trusts me. He also knows I talk to a lot of people online through discord and whatever and he says he doesn't care.
He says he trusts me, when I tell him he can go through my phone whenever he wants he says he doesn't need to because he trusts me. 

But he doesn't trust me enough to actually tell me about his friend? 

I know he cares about me cause when I was talking to him during our argument I could see it in his face, I could see him tearing up a bit because I ended up crying so hard. He told me ""I care about to so much"" and seemed to actually hear me out, but something bounced off like a brick wall. There was also one of those ""I just won't make friends then"" and I was like DUDE I WANT you to make friend I just want you to TELL ME about it. Tell me what is going on.

I will admit I am a big over thinker. I have  bad anxiety and add that I'm going to be seeing a therapist for soon. But it's been one of those things where most things I've ""over thought"" something it typically turns out true. So I don't know how to feel.

I've talked to him about being in an anxious/avoidant relationship before, and I really try to give him space when he needs it.  We agreed to work out our relationship because we both want it.
He's become a bit better at communicating with me and opening up (like now when he doesn't text back or something hell actually be like ""hey sorry I was doing this"" instead of just not saying anything.)
I can tell he's trying, and I know I don't explain it much but I know he cares about me. He doesn't rely on me for money at all. 
If I fall asleep in the couch, hell fall asleep on the other side with me. Or if I'm in the bed hell more than likely go in the bed with me too. 
He's been there for me though a lot, when my dog passed he was heartbroken but strong for me, he's the one that wrapped her up when she passed in our living room, he's held my hand and was my rock through that and when my friend passed away a day later. 
He bought me something recently but it still hasn't arrived. He's opened up a lot since we've started dating, he's become more responsible (though part of that was me pushing him to be) but I know he's got his own demons to figure out in his head. He's got a lot of his own shit going on.

I know he cares about me. But I don't know if he loves me.

I've told him how I have trust issues because some shit that went down with my parents (my parents were those ""oh I wish I had that love"" couple but then when my mom got really sick, I'm p sure my dad cheated on her and it really opened my eyes. He'd talk shit on cheaters, even the one that lived down the street who's kids I was friends with when I was in HS. I also know my father has a porn addiction (he doesn't know I know this) so as an adult I just don't know what the fuck to think. People just aren't who they present themselves to be. And my brain won't let me just trust my bf like that because I just... I don't know.

Sorry this is so long))) this was all about 2 nights ago, we stayed up watching movies last night (both had a day off) and it was good. It felt pretty normal It was nice.
When I woke up this morning, it was to a notif on his phone that was right next to me (he put his phone on the charger on the floor near us, we slept on the couch) and it was a insta notifs, but now his Instagram notifications don't come up individually. It just says 'insatgram notifications"" and bunches them together. And now I don't know if I'm overthinking. 
Like hiding you notifications like that only makes me think more. I've told him the reason I was over thinking was because he never mentioned her at all in the first place and I found out through insta.

Now I feel weird about it and I do want to ask him to change it. I do want to see the messages now but I'm too afraid to ask.

But I don't know how to go about it.

Idk. I just. I want this. I know he wants this. This is both of our first real relationships. But my stupid fucking therapy appt isn't until who knows when (thanks VA!) And I just... I really need some help please. I don't want to fuck this up. 
I don't want to break up with him. I don't know if it just my over thinking or what. I'm so tired.
I feel like I'm my own worst enemy, but my bfs emotional distance doesn't help.

If you have any questions feel free to ask Incase I didn't clarify or something is typed weird. I tried to get as much info as I could out.
Sorry. And thank you. I hope whoever sees this you have a good day. 🙏

• I always call them first which he says is because he doesn't want to call me while l'm with my parents or l'm by doings something important.

 I appreciate it but I have told to him that I would like it if he called me first but he still hasn't...

• We've never met in person, except the first time we saw each other at an event, and he asked for my number

• We go to different schools

• He's very respectful towards me, every time we (FaceTime) I never question if he likes me or not..

• he has asked me to be his girlfriend, but I told him that let's meet up in person, on a date and then we can decide because the feeling was mutual.

we're on the phone and he tells me that he's unable to take me to prom because everybody else is ready for it. he mentions renting a car and expensive dress/suit and that he's just not prepared. (Prom was 20 days away) and I understand that.

relationship_advice,"So, I've made many a post in this subreddit about my situation with my partner over the years. I've pretty much refused to give up on this, and now I'm kinda accepting the reality of needing to.

I love my partner, dearly. We've been through a lot together, and not just the bad. We've had some pretty beautiful moments in the 7 years we've been together. It's been on and off again, there's been infidelity from both sides, spiteful retaliation, verbal and emotional abuse, and mild sexual and physical. I have borderline, so sometimes it's pretty hard to sort out my emotions and they're easily manipulated.

The last time we broke up I was feeling pretty final. I even went as far as to find a new partner, but I ended things on good terms because of my situation with my ex partner and me not being ready to move on from it. I saw other people, experienced things I probably would have never experienced with my ex long-term partner. I made a spicy page for income after losing my job and it's honestly gone better than initially expected, so it's now my main source of income. 

Even broken up, he was still finding ways to come around. We have a kid, not biologically his, but he has been stepped up since I found out I was pregnant. (ons the time we broke up before this, I just chose to keep the kid). My son is used as a manipulation tactic (on both ends tbh) but more often than not he finds a way to guilt trip me with fatherhood. 
He's broken into my house, I've had to call the police to help de-escalate situations. He's even gone as far as messing with my smart home devices when I blocked him from being able to contact me. They've since been removed from his home group so he cannot do it again.

We've been on and off fighting about my spicy page recently, which, I was upfront about and told him I'd be keeping it if we were trying things again as it's my only source of income at this point in time. I can't mention men talking to me or vent about the messages I get, I can't be excited about big financial gains or people sending me gifts without it making him insecure, which is the opposite of what I'm trying to do because we have a policy of transparency with it. I've asked him how we compromise. I've offered to let him make a list of services I can provide for my fans that he's comfortable with. I've asked him if he wants me to hire people to do the socializing and promoting so I don't have to spend my time doing that myself. I've asked if he wants to go through my messages, be the one filming, be a part of my content, etc. Anything I could think of to make him more secure, and his only argument is ""Well, you wouldn't like it if I was doing it"" which is absolutely untrue and I'd honestly love for him to make his own page so we can double down on the bag but, whatever. He pointed out he'd rather be swingers, and I pointed out I'd rather be a camgirl and swing with other couples for gains.

He's also been fighting with me about mentioning my partner to my fans. Sometimes people ask to meet up and I simply say it's illegal for them to financially compensate for those services and ask them not to do it again. He wants me to say ""sorry I have a boyfriend"" but, we're not publicly together at this point in time, and obviously I'm not sure how seriously committed I am at this point. My other standpoint is my spicy page is meant to sell a fantasy, it's an act, and it sells better when fans assume you're single. (Hence why I'm posting under a throwaway) I also don't *want* to have any relations with my fans, relationship or not. It's a line in the sand you have to draw when you make a career of this. It's not that I'm trying to hide for a partner, but I'm trying to sell a fantasy under a fake name, they don't need to know my personal life. I'm selective about what I tell them in general. 

I'm honestly just sick of fighting about it. It feels like he's trying to bully me into deleting it. He's bullied me like this about removing guy-friends he views as threats. The fights are filled with gas-lighting and victimization, cannon fodder, pedantics, passive aggressive comments, etc. We don't get anywhere. I barely have the energy to care about life anymore. I'm trying to be a mother to my son and run my business that's gonna be there whether or not he cheats on me again. I can't even do my hair and makeup without him asking me who I'm getting pretty for, or send him nudes without him making some passive aggressive comment about how my fans will probably enjoy them. 

At this point, leaving feels like less effort tbh. And, being treated by men the way I am is making me realize this guy is doing the bare minimum. My little fling this last December really confirmed it. Loyalty, Trust, and actual empathy and caring affection went such a long way. In the 4 months I was talking to Dec, we never fought once. We disagreed, but we always found a compromise. A healthy situation really changed my perspective. That's all I want. It's starting to become apparent that we'll probably never achieve that. We've both been in therapy, and it just keeps getting worse. He's still repeated the infidelitious behavior as recently as last month, after making me block anyone interested in me on social media and promising that we're both 100% in it. His excuse was he was drunk and made a bad choice. 

TDLR: my partner has a major problem with my spicy page that I've had previously to this bout of dating and is trying to tell me it's a deal breaker and guilt me into deleting it. We have a kid with complicated circumstances, and I'm honestly feeling like I'm settling for a dude that's just going to abuse me into submission for the rest of my life if I stay. He's broken into my house, stalked me, and gone as far as to mess with my smart tech in my home to bother me. We have past issues of infidelity and domestic violence.

How the hell do I leave in the cleanest way possible? I've literally spent my entire adult life in a relationship with him and I depend on him for financial support with my child. If we were to stop seeing each other, I'd need help getting baby items on a regular basis and my BD is dodging child support/paternity establishment papers. Should I allow him to continue being in my child's life after the fact? He was the first person this kid ever saw. I need help with making a plan, and I don't have a very dependable support system for this. We live separately, though I've been staying at his apartment for a month. I do have clothes and other items there, but they're separated from his. He doesn't have any possessions  at my home.

relationship_advice,"My bf(29m) and I(24f)have been seeing each other seriously for the past 6 months. He has been really great to me, we have a lot in common, and he is gorgeous.   

My friend sent me a link to a FB profile. It had one of those on this day 1 years ago posts and it was a picture of her and my bf. Her profile says she is married but there are no recent posts of them. They were at some point very much married. This really hurt and upset me and I don’t know what to say or do. He could still be married and has been lying to me or maybe they are separated and getting divorced. Even if they are separated it is still a major thing to hide and I think after 6 months that is plenty of time to tell me. I did not expect this from him. 

I have not confronted him yet because I want our text history and my nudes off of his phone before I do just in case. I don’t know what is the most likely scenario. He has spent nights with me, we go out, I have met some of his friends, he doesn’t really act sketchy so if he has been hiding a secret wife he is great at it. He lives like 30 minutes away so that would probably make things easier for him and if they were separated why would she share a photo of them from one year ago? Any advice when I talk to him? Should I go through his phone when I delete my nudes or would that be really wrong? I am not sure what to expect. Should I try to work it out of it turns out they are separated and getting divorced?

I (24 f) asked my (30 f) partner to show me more affection and she thinks I’m being over dramatic. I probably am, but I got to get this off my chest. (Also I did post this is another group by accident so if this sounds familiar don’t worry!) 

We’ve been seeing each other for a while, we don’t live together, she works 2 days while I work from home (I’m a freelance artist so I work whenever I’m commissioned) the issue lies with when we see each other, she goes about her day as if I wasn’t there, she’s glued to the TV all the time and doesn’t start conversations or any physical interaction (cuddling, hand holding, etc) the only time she seems to pay any interest in me is when it comes down to sex.  I’m always the one starting things (cuddling, handholding,etc) but she doesn’t, she did when we first got together but after a month it stopped. 

She makes no effort to come down to visit me I’m always visiting her, it’s an hour journey and neither of us drive and public transportation is an absolute nightmare. (She even goes to lengths to pay for my travel so she doesn’t have to come down to me.) 

Even on FaceTime she’s the same she’s glued to the TV and barley says a word. 

I do my best to talk to her about things I know she’s interested in to try keep a conversation going but it’s like talking to a wall, I even tried turning the tv off and she’ll just go about doing her chores (cleaning, etc) i feel like I’m only being used. 

I’ve spoken to her about this on several occasions and she doesn’t think she’s doing anything wrong, I’ve begged for her to show me more affection and she just calls me dramatic.

So tonight on FaceTime I decided to play her at her own game, I sat in silence watching tv. And nothing was said for over an hour, until she asked me what my issue was. I told her I didn’t have an issue. She left it at that, a while later I’m texting away to my friend on my phone and she says “if you just want to go to talk other people then just go.” I told her “I’d rather talk to you but you never talk to me.” And she hung up. She hasn’t said anything since. 

I’ve tried talking to her about all this, how she makes me feel used but nothing changes yet when she has an issue with me she expects me to drop everything and do it.

I’ll try to make this short &amp; to the point. I (39F) started seeing, let’s call him Billy (34M) at the end of January just about a week before he went on deployment. So we obviously haven’t had much time together. 

A little background: He asked me that while he was gone not to go on dates etc so that we could revisit when he gets home because he likes me and did not like the idea of me dating others. So I agreed to this as I genuinely do like him also. 

Fast forward to my concern. He got home this past Sunday. He only got 2 days off work before he had to go back so today was his first day back. I did not expect to see him these first couple of days as he had a lot to do in order to get his life back in order after being gone for 4 months. However, I feel a little disappointed that he has made no effort at all to make plans in the near future. 

I had a talk with him last night about it and he said he needs to get used to being back home again and get back in to a routine as well as get all his affairs back in order. He promises he will see me soon. I’ve never been in the military so I don’t know what it’s like. I’m excited to see him and I feel he should be too. But again, I don’t know what it does to you mentally when you’re on a ship 4 months straight working 7 days a week. I’m trying to be understanding but my girlfriends are no help because they don’t understand deployments either lol. They are telling me it’s unacceptable he hasn’t tried to see me yet. But again, I don’t know what it’s like for him! 

Are there any military people present or past that could maybe help me understand where he is coming from? Or am I wasting my time? It’s just a tough situation because we literally hardly got any time together before he shipped off! Any advice would be greatly appreciated on how I should proceed.

relationship_advice,"The other night I witnessed the girl (18f) that i'm into making out with another guy. Obviously it's something that makes me sick, but I think it made me realize something. 

I went out a couple of times with this girl but never attempted to kiss her. I didn't want to force it and it ended up backfiring on me. Not taking a risk made me lose her. 

However, I realized that this is not the first time I have not carried things through with girls who have feelings for me.

It has happened to me before that I had a girl (21f) who was obviously interested in me, but instead of pursuing that relationship, I moved away from her, and when she later got engaged to someone else, I still felt bad about it, as if it wasn't my fault that we had drifted apart. 

So I thought, is it possible that it's really me sabotaging any chance I have with girls who like me? I feel like it's like I'm looking for the pain, the disappointment of being abandoned. 

I know that the way we relate to the opposite sex is highly influenced by how our parents behaved in front of us. 

Here, my parents (56m)(59f) were never lovers to each other for me. I always saw them as mom and dad, but never as husband and wife. I think I saw them kissing a couple of times in my whole life. 

They don't get along and it's basically like they're divorced. Growing up I never saw a healthy display of love. Just anger, sadness and disappointment.

It started with me asking a hypothetical question about if he would be bothered if I were to post pictures of my body on social media and I assumed he wouldn’t mind because he’s not controlling in other aspects, for example, he doesn’t check my phone, he doesn’t care if I wear revealing clothing and he doesn’t care about me hanging out with other guys either, but he said he would care and that it would bother him if I did post my body, which I understood mostly.  

Then it got to me asking if he would care if I posted pictures of JUST my face and he said that would make him uncomfortable too, he said even me posting my toe would make him uncomfortable and this is where my concern is…for reference, he has an instagram where he posts pictures of himself but his reason as to why it’s different to him is because he posts pictures “just because” and he thinks I would post pictures to seek attention. He said he couldn’t stop me, but that it would upset him.

 I understand him not wanting me to post pictures of my body but my face or even my toe??it just seems weird. He’s mad that he has no say in whether I post selfies or not. I’m aware this isn’t normal but is it a cause for concern? I know behavior like this can get worse but it’s been two years and this is really the only controlling behavior he’s exhibited.

relationship_advice,"So it started about six months ago. Suddenly inside jokes that we had became bad. She has bad vision, so I used to call her “Velma” and she would call me “Shaggy” when I would find her glasses for her. One time she couldn’t find her glasses, so I said “I’ll find them for you Velma.” Cue to a 2 day fight, with her main complaint that I’m making fun of her eyesight. 

This was just the start. Being that I was raised in a southern conservative household, I do not know how to properly display my emotions. Over the last few years my wife has been helping me with properly displaying my emotions. She is used to me being the strong and silent type. So when I show emotion, she doesn’t know how to handle it. 

Recently, things have happened. Things that bother me. Things I have brought to the attention of my wife.

Every time I have brought it up, she has laughed. Or not taking me seriously. We had a fight recently. I told her how I felt and she laughed. I was not at fault, but I still apologized. During my apology, she rolled her eyes. True to RPG fashion “I remembered that”.  It’s happened several times before, but I disregarded it. 

I understand that she is not used to dealing with my emotions. What can I do? I’ve tried talking to her about it, but she treats it like it’s not an issue. I’m dismissed.

relationship_advice,"Hi all, I’ll try and make this brief.

Used to be “friends” with this guy a long time ago when we were roommates at end of college. Even before anything went down, saying we’re friends was a stretch; I honestly didn’t like him before and would be happy to never see him ever again.

Background: we had a handful of roommates who lived at this house. Most all of us were friends. A tragic event happened and one of the roommates passed. It was a very stressful time for all of us. When rent was due the next month at our house I asked everyone for rent (I’d deliver to the landlord) but this one guy decided to move out and not pay. It put all of us in a weird position as we were short the money. I called him and let him have it because emotions were still high and to think this guy would do further damage to his friends/roommates by not paying rent because he up and moved out (we had a lease) after one of us just passed away. We ended up getting it figured out without him but that move was forever etched in me. It showed all his true colors in a moment of sadness for everyone.

Well, he is a selfish narcissist type (everything given to him since he was a child, very spoiled) and didn’t take my choice words very well. He started gossiping to every person he could that knew me and tried to drag my name thru the mud. It worked for some, for others they saw right it. I didn’t resort to his level, I stayed with the facts and went on my way. I made sure to not talk or see this person ever again.

Fast forward - my good friend is getting married and I’m the best man. He’s inviting this guy I hate to the bachelor party and I’m not sure what to do. I cannot stand him for his actions in the past and while bachelor parties are supposed to be a good time I know it’s going to make me feel off.

What should i do? I’m still so mad and this was years ago. I’m not sure how I will react. I don’t want to ruin my friend getting married’s time with this drama. I want him to have a fun bachelor party because it’s about him not me.",0,I’m (M30) going to have to see someone (M30) I’ve tried hard to not see for years at a Bach party.

relationship_advice,"I (48M) have been in a long-distance relationship with an Indonesian woman (45F) for about 2.5 years. We started talking online just a few months after my late wife died (breast cancer.) She has visited me here in the US several times, and I've visited her, met her family etc. We got married in Sept 2022 and started the visa process (which takes around a year or more.)  The game plan was for her to move here around the end of this year.  Just to address any such concerns up-front: she's financially independent, has lived in the US before, and isn't merely seeking a visa / money.

The problems I'm going to describe below have been at issue since just a few months into the relationship, and I've waffled repeatedly on how to handle them. Now we're at a crisis point and I have to make a decision.

To try and summarize a complex situation, she suffers from extreme mood swings, and in the context of our relationship, they're most commonly (but not exclusively) triggered by conversations associated with my late wife. I go out of my way to not bring up my LW, because I've known for a long time that she's uncomfortable with my being a widower, but it's a topic that recurs, and about which she has repeatedly made unkind remarks. Other triggers have included her taking exception to who I follow on YouTube / IG, whether I post on social media about our relationship, and with whom I discuss our relationship.

Obviously, every relationship involves conflict, but the crux of the issue with us isn't really what we're in conflict \*about\* but how she handles her frustration. Once triggered, she proceeds directly to threatening the relationship i.e. ""you should just divorce me then"", ""obviously we shouldn't be together, so have a nice life"", followed by blocking me. Those (somewhat watered down) examples are via chat, but in-person, she has 1) stormed off from a hotel we were staying at together and been gone for hours, 2) taken an Uber to the airport and changed her flight just a couple days into a 2-week visit, 3) started packing her bags to leave on the morning of our wedding day (but relented.)

These episodes follow a particular cycle that has become clear over time. There's the initial critical exchange on a topic, then anger, then saying she wants to break up / divorce, followed by a few days of silence, followed by her apologizing, blaming herself and telling me I should move on &amp; be with someone else. I reject that, she apologies, we reconcile and the timer starts again. At most, we get 3-4 weeks before the above cycle repeats, based on either an old grievance or a newly invented one.

I proposed couple's counseling, and we managed to get through two sessions before she cancelled the rest and repeated the ""we should just break up"" cycle. I eventually put down an ultimatum, saying that I didn't want to continue the relationship unless she, or us together, pursued counseling. She agreed, then delayed, and delayed, and then we went through the cycle again after, on my late wife's death anniversary, she made a point to say that she ""didn't need to know"" how I was feeling, and that she'd just leave me alone all day (after I'd asked for her to just ""be normal"" on that day.)

It's just a never-ending cycle of drama and I'm emotionally exhausted. I love this person, but I've never had to deal with someone like this and I can't imagine spending years/decades never knowing when she's going to storm off and get on a plane back home.

**TLDR:** trying to decide whether to end a marriage with a very volatile partner who doesn't want to engage in counseling / therapy. Decision made more difficult because she periodically acknowledges and apologizes for her volatility.

**Objective of this post:** Perspectives and opinions from others who may love (or have loved) a volatile person. At what point did you decide to throw in the towel?

relationship_advice,"I (25F) am dating my boyfriend (30M) for a little over a year now. I am really keen on collecting memories and usually keep receipts from restaurants, pictures and other things that remember me of valuable time together with people I love (keeping receipts is not about the price printed on them!)

My boyfriend learned how much I love dates as I tried to set up as many things as I could over the course of the first 6 months.
We are long distance, met on weekends and I planned something for almost every visit at my place.

We are both into gaming and also share lots of memes. But despite me spending many date or co-op game ideas his way, not much happens from his own effort.

Over the year we date now he got me two concert tickets that were amazing, thoughtful and made for good times, but for the last couple of months things got kind of flat.

I found myself at a point where I would ask him to suggest a game to play together and he would respond with ""why don't you look for one?""
I would like to see a movie with him, is there something interesting? ""Why won't you look for a movie?""
He always gives those things back to me. He does voice opinions and its not about making sure its a choice I like. He straight up bounces the ball back, so to say.

Now... I want to have a conversation with him about how I feel and why I feel that way. In the end I would want him to plan a date for us. All his ideas, I am really open for anything! All I want to see really is if this man is capable of planning a date on his own, as this is a standard I want to have in a relationship.

Ofc I also want to plan dates. I also got him flowers, I also got something for his birthday, I do really care for him.

relationship_advice,"This is a \*very\* complex situation with a lot of moving parts, so I'll try to explain it in the best way I can-

So I (19F) am the vice president of a college comedy club with about six other people. I've been in the club for two whole years, this one girl C (20F) has been in for two and a half, and this new kid J (19NB) has only just gotten in about two months ago. C and J were friends from a different club before J joined the group, and the two of them were... extremely close.

J is absolutely wonderful, they slipped right into the group dynamic like they've always been there, and is just the sweetest and most caring person I can imagine. However, C is a very uncomfortable presence in the club. I was friends with her when we first met, but very quickly she revealed herself to be manipulative, power hungry, and has a lot of narcissistic tendencies. Me and everyone else in the group are best friends, and this semester we have begun airing our grievances about C. Talking about our own personal experience with how she's hurt us, and discussing steps on how to make the group not so much of a hostile atmosphere.

Time goes on, C and J are so close the rest of the group starts to talk about weather or not they're secretly dating, and there's a lot of evidence that point that way- walking each other home, fully cuddling in the library, constantly around each other. The only time they're not acting couple-y is when they're actually at rehearsal, in which case they do not speak or even make eye contact. This greatly concerned us because yes of course they're both adults and can do whatever they want, but we know that C would \*not\* be a good and kind partner to J, and J doesn't seem to have the best judgement when it comes to  manipulative/abusive relationships.

We tried to keep all the drama away from J because we knew they were friends / possible lovers and we didn't want them to be uncomfortable, either around C or the group itself. But all of a sudden, the two of them completely stopped hanging out or speaking, which we all interpreted as meaning our fears were false, so we all breathed a sigh of relief and never spoke about it again. But, since we've been avoiding talking about it with J, we have no idea what their ideas about C are, or if they can feel the tension within the group.

Time goes on, and me and J slowly started becoming very very good friends- studying together, hanging out til' early in the morning, and forming an informal jam band with a third friend. We are both \*very\* physically affectionate people, and most of my best friends are rather touch-adverse (which I fully respect!), but finding out that me and J have similar touch tastes, we've ended up cuddling/holding hands/being physically affectionate in some way most of the time we are around each other, although obviously we refrain for the most part in public/around the club and mutual friends. It being finals week and both of us stressed out of our minds, we've been having sleepovers for several nights in a row in which we have ended up falling asleep in the same bed, spooning and cuddling other.

This past weekend, the club takes a two day trip to the big city near us for a comedy convention- this is a HUGE DEAL for us, and we've been working towards it for months, plus it's a great opportunity to bond within the club as we explore a big city together. Due to scheduling conflicts, J had to drive C alone there and back- and we all picked up on the fact that J seemed a lot less animated as they usually are.

After we all arrive back on campus, J calls me up to hang out. The moment they see me, they break down about their feelings towards C. Turns out- they actually were dating (both romantically and maintaining a sexual relationship) at the beginning of them joining the group, but eventually broke up due to some downright abusive behavior from C. Turns out, C had \*explicitly\* told them that they could never tell the rest of the group the fact that the two of them were dating for fear of retaliation (which we would not do). J totally internalized this, and has been absolutely terrified to talk about their feelings towards C's behavior, or even letting us know the fact that they were dating in the first place.

This was just absolutely heartbreaking to hear. I consider J one of my best friends \*and\* I'm a club leader, so hearing that J was scared to talk to me on either of those front about their fears because C told them they couldn't was downright scary.

And to top it all off, J came up to me to ask if our friendship dynamic was bad, or if we should hide and lie about the fact we are physically affectionate and sleep in the same bed. Because of what C said to them, they're still thinking that they have to hide all of their interpersonal relationships from the group. I asked if they were uncomfortable with what we have been doing, and they said no, but they're worried that if the rest of the group found out about how we act then they'll assume the worst and get mad at us. The worst part is that I've also been keeping what we do alone on the downlow, not to hide it, just because it feels very weird to announce to all our friends than we spoon on the regs. But, the fact I haven't been saying anything has been feeding into their anxieties that we're doing something wrong.

I don't want them to think that I'm at all like C, and I don't want our friendship to end in a similar way as C. We are not at all romantically or sexually involved with one another, but now I'm worried that from their perspective I'm being just as sneaky as C was. And, on top of it all, I'm starting to doubt weather or not it's a good idea in the first place to be this level of physically affectionate with a club member who just got out of a very manipulative relationship, despite the fact that they're the one who has been mostly asking for/initiating the contact. I really deeply care about J, and they deserve to be treated in the best way possible. 

Any advice is highly highly appreciated.

So my failed relationship that was with a coworker has taken and interesting turn and now I’m seeking therapy. But anywho. This girl that I know we’ve been working together now for about a year and a half. 
I helped her through absolutely the lowest points in her life and we ended up being fwbs after a while of being that I found out she’s not quite relationship material. She is a very damaged person and very much a manipulator. As I’ve now come to terms the hard way. She broke it off with me and I’m really not dealing with it well. She wants to be friends and I’m not having any of it tbh. “She wants to be just in good terms nothing more”.

More recently she has a new bf that lives about 20 minutes away. I literally live next to her….. yea I know lmao we had no idea at first lol. So recently her boy bsf had a falling out with her and she took all his stuff outside of her apartment and she was very worried about his reaction. She told me she thought that I would have her back and be there for her, and told me how she had my number on speed dial just in case. But I feel like she’s now evolving the “just on good terms” to now something more like reallllly good friends. I told her that’s not fair cause she knows how I still feel and maybe she needs to get her bf to deal with issues like that. She complained that he lives 20 minutes away and cause I live a minute it’s fair to her.

But he’s given me the ultimatum that every time I touch his butt, he’s going to watch a video (porn).
He knows that idea hurts me because he was sneaky with his secondary Instagram in the past and what he was doing on it. He also knows that him watching porn heavily impacts his ability to perform even hours later, and that it would make me severely insecure.

relationship_advice,"There's a bit of history that I won't get into. The gist is this: My boyfriend broke up with me in February from previous trust issues. I was venting to a friend about it and she sent a picture of her and a friend. I made a joke asking if he'd be my post-break up hookup - we had had sex once before. Me and my boyfriend got back together, I told him about what I had said. My friends planned a camping trip and said guy was going to be there. My boyfriend asked me early on who was going and I didn't say said guy, but named other friends. I was going getting ready to leave, BF called to talk to me and asked specifically if said guy was going, I said yes. He said he felt betrayed I didn't tell him when he asked earlier. He broke up with me again - which I later realized was a test. I begged him not to and said it can't be like last time. If he wants to break up with me, he has to mean it and he said he won't be back and it's over. I was devastated, cried the whole drive down, cried myself to sleep and the next morning. The next night, I was again crying about it and said guy was getting flirty - he knew BF had just broken up with me because it's all I had been talking about, so we laid down together. We kissed, and fell asleep together and it felt good in the moment to be comforted in that way. I cried the next morning and realized it was the wrong way to cope. I got back from the trip and was cancelling flights to see BF and asked him if he was sure because I was having a hard time coming to terms, and he asked if I had slept with the guy, and I told him what happened. He said it was  confirmation I was going to cheat on him the whole time. We're talking again now and he's livid that I slept with the guy and took that as confirmation that I was going to go down and cheat on him. I feel hopeless, I feel like I'm hurting him, I feel like I should let him go, but I love him. I've never loved anyone this much. I know he loves me, but he keeps lashing out because he's hurt and is upset that I slept with said guy.  Do I let him go and let him be happy?

relationship_advice,"Me and my boyfriend have been together almost 2 years now, living together for 3+ months. We're bestfriends and we've been each others first everything. However lately, I can't stop having these thoughts of breaking up with him. It's to the point where I haven't slept properly for weeks and I haven't gone a day without crying.

The problem is he's too needy...

If I say I want some alone time, he'll start to question everything about my feelings towards him. He says I shouldn't want time away from my bf and I must not care about him that much.

I booked a 5 day trip away from him in May as I've dreamed about travelling for so long, but he's saying I'm selfish because I'm going to make him lonely. I'm so f\*cking angry at him for ruining my excitement over this trip, like, it was the only thing making me happy and now he's made me feel like a terrible gf for wanting to go. *(I did a full post about this on here last week which gained a lot of attraction).*

I'm currently at home visiting family so me and my bf have been a part for almost 2 days and he's already complaining that I haven't been texting him enough which means I'm not putting enough effort into the relationship. 

When I explained this to him (that I have still been texting/sending pics to him &amp; it's only been 2 days) he just said ""in which case i'm being unreasonably needy, my bad"".

I'm exhausted at this point. Do you think there's anything I can do to resolve this?

If I do break up with him it's going to be difficult since I still have 2.5 months left living with him. I just know it's going to result in him begging me to take him back, and we'll probably end up having sex still because for some reason I can't stop, even during times we're arguing.

Plus, I don't have anyone else... I fell out of touch with all my friends when I started dating him and moved away from my family to live with him when he started a new job in a new city. Not to mention, I work from home so I don't have work colleagues.

relationship_advice,"Hi, I’ve been feeling really emotional because of my complicated relationship with my situationship, and I’m not sure I understand what I’m feeling and what I want. If I’m being honest, it’s been a very toxic relationship, and that’s largely my fault, which is why I think I need to reflect and better understand my feelings. I’d also like to add that my brother passed away shortly before the start of all this, as I think my mental state during the time adds some context to the story, I was feeling really lost.

So we started talking over the summer at the start of the pandemic over dm, we went to the same college, and are from the same hometown, everything kind of clicked right away. She pretty much liked me and wanted to date from the start, but at the time I had really strong feelings for another girl I’d had a crush on for all of college. This other girl had a boyfriend but I knew she liked me so I still held on to that hope. Meanwhile, with this new girl at first I just wanted sex, but after talking for a bit, I realized what a sweet and fun person she was to talk to. Soon all my time was spent texting her, we were playing games and watching shows over facetime, and this went on for about a month before we started sleeping together. She was a super sweet girl, and she lost her dad when she was young, I had come to genuinely care for her and so I felt guilty that I was kind of playing her. So, before the first time she came over, I told her that I didn’t want a relationship. I justified to myself that because I was being honest about my intentions I wasn’t leading her on. But now I realize I was just taking advantage of the fact that I knew she would go with it because she liked me, and I was lonely from quarrantine. She would come over usually once a week, and that continued all the way through December 2020. 

Around the holidays and new year, I started to distance myself a bit from her as she had to go back to campus while I had the option to stay back home due to lockdown. We still texted and facetimed everyday, but I didn’t see her again until April 2021, she would beg me every week to come visit her. Around the end of March 2021 she got really sad one day and cried to me and then asked me if I wanted to just be non exclusive. I had no intentions of getting with other girls, but I said okay because I couldn’t give her what she really wanted, a relationship. Well, I come back 2 weeks later, and she hands me the Christmas present she never got the chance to give me because I hadn’t seen her, she got me a plushy, shoes, and a hoodie in a homemade box and card that she decorated with stickers. It was really the sweetest and most thoughtful gift anyone has ever given me, and at that moment I told her I’m sorry and that I wanted her to be my girlfriend. Things are great for a week or two, but then I was at a friends house and learned she had slept with my friends housemate a few days after we agreed to be non exclusive, my friend didn’t actually know that I had been talking to her or that we were together though as I never mentioned her. Upon learning this I felt hurt and betrayed. In my head I knew that I had told her to go for it, and I thought I really did want her to find someone else, but I didn’t think it would actually happen and that she could replace me. I was also hurt that it was so soon after, that my friend knew about it, and I think because I didn’t go sleep with anyone else. I confronted her about it and she started crying and saying that she was sorry but when she explained her side it made me feel worse, as it seemed like she was just trying to tell me what she thought I would want to hear and it just felt like a lie. Even though she just did exactly what I told her, it felt like I couldn’t see her the same, like the girl that was so sweet to me wasn’t there anymore. I told her I couldn’t date her, and she said she didn’t want to lose me and we went back to the whole situationship thing. It all sounds so immature now when I’m writing this. 

That then continues on for over a year, we kinda pretended we were in a relationship, but I really didn’t treat her well, I never took her on dates, she would always ask me to go to events and concerts and I would say no, wouldn’t hold her hand. We still had fun and were happy around each other but, I felt weird about doing sentimental things with her after what happened. Her sex drive is quite a bit lower than mine, and the times when she wouldn’t want to have sex I would get upset and distant. From my perspective I was doing things for her, giving her my time and I was thinking about how she had gotten with the other guy so easily. At this time, I felt bad for how I was treating her, but I guess I just felt like I had to treat her this way to run from the pain, and because of my ego. I was comforting myself by telling myself that I shouldn’t care that she was with someone else because I just want her for sex. But I think I was lying to myself or didn’t know how I honestly felt. Yet, she would still always tell me she loved me and that she would never leave me.

Fast forward summer 2022, I stayed at my college apartment and she went back home which is 2 hours away. This is where things got bad, she would only drive up to visit me on weekends, and while she was away the thoughts would haunt me. Meanwhile, she was getting tired from driving two hours every weekend while working and when she got here we would mostly just have sex. Towards the end of summer she got upset that I hadn’t driven once to visit her, and I finally did one weekend for a friends birthday, I hung out with her the next day though. But she was hurt that I came back for my friend when she had been asking me all summer. She then invited me to go to a music festival with her, to which I said no. She ended up going with her friends, and I think this was the last straw for her, and she decides to ends things with me. I think in the moment I got scared to lose her so I begged her to stay, but then she said she recently met a new guy and thinks she has feelings for him. Shes telling me that this guy actually shows her genuine interest, and I’m hurt, but I understand. This is the first time she actually told me herself how bad I’d been treating her, because she was always scared she’d lose me if she brought up an argument. This made me feel extremely guilty and sad, I know I hadn’t been treating her right but for the most part she was usually very happy when we were together. 

Over the next two weeks I feel a lot of guilt, and one day I was at a music festival and felt really lonely even though I was with friends, and realized that I had been putting her through that and called her to apologize and ask for one more chance. At first she blocks me, but the next day shows up crying at my door asking if I wanted to be serious with her, I say yeah, and she then says she needs some time to think about it because the other guy treats her very well. Over the next week we’re talking again, but then one day she says she can’t continue, and we get emotional, at the end of it comes out that she gave the new guy a blowjob. I again feel betrayed and lied to, especially because the first day she came back she told me they hadn’t done anything yet but that was a lie, and then she did it again after she said she was thinking of getting back together. I felt extremely betrayed that while I was thinking of how to make things up to her she was getting intimate with someone else, that she lied to me, and that it was so soon again for someone she left me for. On that last point I know she was single and that she had every right, but it just feels disrespectful to what we did have. I did however also sleep with a few girls this time, so I’m not sure if it’s fair for me to feel this way. But it just doesn’t feel the same as I handled it in a way that doesn’t involve her at all, and I waited longer. It also complicated my emotions more, as I only learned about it after I realized my feelings for her both times. So I then feel betrayed but still want her.

Now for the past couple months we’ve been on and off and I’ve just overwhelmed and confused with different emotions. We’re in a really weird place and we haven’t had sex in months, and I think both of us are very confused. I feel lots of guilt and regret over how I treated her, and I would do anything to make things up to her. But at the same time, I feel like my feelings were valid as well, although maybe deserved. Why do I feel this way? Logically, I know I’m wrong, but I just can’t shake the feelings of betrayal. I always wanted to make her happy because I care for her as a person and friend, but I didn’t see her as a long term partner. Both times I thought I wanted her to leave, and I would always tell her she deserves better, but when it actually happened I wasn’t ready to lose her. Is this because I did actually have feelings or it was just me being jealous?",0,Need help understanding my (23M) emotions from messy situationship (22F),r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,8871226,1682544693,0,1682544706,1682544707,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,10,1788
relationship_advice,"I've been with my fiance for five years and earlier in our relationship I proposed to her and she said yes. Things felt great at the time, we had no kids together, and sex wasn't the best but it was acceptable. We also had many shared interests and were on the same page when discussing what we would like our futures to look like.

To cut a long story short, our relationship for the most part has been great! We've now got two children together and we are due to get married next year. However, as time has past us by I am now unsure whether I want to marry her and it's eating me up because we've started to plan and pay for things in preparation for the wedding. The reason I now have my reservations is because of the following:

\- Affection is a huge thing for me and we hardly have that now...so I often wonder what it would be like being stuck in a marriage with little to no affection. I feel that women are usually more naturally affectionate but it doesn't really exist with my fiance. We hardly cuddle or kiss and could easily go 1 month without sex. I want my partner to be affectionate, I want her to spontaneously kiss me, randomly massage me, and have sex with me. I like sex, I want sex and think that a sexual relationship really helps foster a healthier relationship but it's as though she has little to no sex drive. She never initiates sex and never really has since we've been together, she doesn't want to try new things when we do have sex and I get the feeling that she doesn't even really enjoy it often because I make her climax during foreplay before having sex. All this has made me less willing to be affectionate towards her and I often feel like I'm playing games with myself, waiting to see if she will initiate something and it's driving me crazy. I've spoken to her about my issues and she never really addresses the issues apart from saying that she's never really had a high sex drive and also says that since she has had kids she is less confident, despite me telling her all the time that I love her body and everything about her. As mentioned earlier, before kids she was slightly more affectionate and in fact, was eager for sex when she wanted kids. After speaking about it with her, she said she would change but it never happens and we always end up back in the same place and I now question whether I want to commit to a woman that doesn't satisfy my needs.

I had two kids with this woman and proposed to her because I really thought that we were going to be together forever but I don't think I can marry someone who cannot satisfy my needs.

relationship_advice,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for the past seven months. We previously dated in hs but broke up because it was a toxic relationship. We took some time for ourselves, and we started dating again during my junior year of college( so almost 3-3.5 years later). During our time apart, I had a sort of mental clarity and realized that I wanted to be with her. I initiated our talking again, and we reconnected and started dating. At the very beginning of our relationship, she let me know that she loved me, but she wasn't 100% sure that she wanted to be with me and that while she liked me at the moment and wanted to see where things, she wasn't sure if she saw that long time future as I did. I told her that was fine, especially considering our past history and everything. Fast forward seven months, and things were good. We had our ups and downs, like any relationship, but overall it was healthy and good. She said that she saw a future with me and wanted to be with me for the long term. However, something changed, and she was now unsure if this relationship is what she wants/needs. She said she isn’t sure if really likes me and what this relationship means to her. She said that she loves the time we spent time together, but she felt like she needs to be single right now. She said that she wants to take a break and focus on herself and be single. She said that she doesn't know how to be happy on her own and that she is genuinely codependent on the relationship. She also said that she can’t give me some of my bare minimums requirements and that it was not fair to me to just compromise for her. The only issue we really ran into during the course of our relationship was that she was always so busy. We go to college about 2 hours away from each other. I drive down pretty much every other weekend to spend time with her. However, during the week, she is always so busy and never has time to really talk. I’m only asking for a conversation sometime during the day and one time at night before I go to bed. In my opinion, that's a bare minimum. Of course, I understand everyone is busy. She is an extremely busy person, so if she says that she is busy one day or even over a period of a week and can’t talk at all, that’s fine. My issue was that it was pretty much every single day. She said that the only reason she calls me at night some days is because she knows that it's what I want. If it were up to her, she would just go to bed without calling me and talking to me at all.

We discussed all these things, and she said she needs a break for a week to figure things out for herself and see if this is something she really wants. What do I do?  I can tell that she is going through a lot right now and that maybe a relationship isn’t something she can handle right now. Is that the right way of looking at it? Is there really no hope, or any way I can make our relationship work? Is it time to let go?

The constant comparisons I make in my head daily are not fair to her or myself and ultimately may lead me to pushing my current GF away. Hell one day I called my current Gf my exes name, but she thankfully didn’t hear it. My current GF often expresses that I don’t show affection enough and deep down I know I don’t because I truly don’t love her as much as I did my ex. I don’t think I’ll ever love someone like that again. 

I love my current GF, but theirs just this voice on repeat in my head telling me she isn’t as good as my ex all the time. It’s draining. I imagine a lot of you reading this are thinking I should leave my current GF until I sort my shit out, but I honestly feel like this feeling I have will never go away. So do I just remain single, depressed, and lonely until it vanishes?

relationship_advice,"I (Male, 20) have been struggling with jealousy a lot but I feel deep down I shouldn't be. I have been in a good amount of past relationships, 3-4 (lasted around 4-8 months respectfully)and 2 of those have ended because of my partner cheating on me with guys that to me were nothing but ""unsuspecting friends"". 
I have always been someone who is blissfully ignorant and doesn't try to prevent cheating because it seems inevitable if they truly want to, but I'm starting to notice as I rejoin the dating scene in college that whenever a girl I'm seeing mentions hanging out with another guy (even if it's been made very clear she has no intentions) my heart drops, I get super tense and my mood and sometimes day is ruined. I tell myself there's nothing to worry about and everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt but I refuse to be played for a fool again. I have a feeling this will negatively effect me even more down the road as this feeling is strong in me even at the start of relationships and I really don't wanna become that crazy possessive boyfriend. I feel crazy to say I feel this way to them if they've made it clear they don't intend to do anything and I don't want them thinking I don't trust them. I know I'm young and still learning but I refuse to believe this feeling is normal. 

Am i crazy for getting these feelings?
What can I do to stop this?

relationship_advice,"Okay, A LOT of context (sorry!):

Met in college. We are approaching 3 years together and I love her dearly. We have been in an LDR for 1.5 years. I graduated and moved halfway across the country from a state with zero jobs for a golden ticket job that would jumpstart my career in a major city. While sad, she has been very supportive. In the meantime, she completed her final year of college and moved to a major city closer to our home state to start her career.

**Moving situation:** I'm about to make a major move back to her city in a little over 2 months. My company has agreed to let me work remote there. GF and I have agreed to not live together for a year to get used to a normal relationship again, then find an apartment together after (This was my preference, and she agreed).

**Career situations:** I make quite a bit more than my GF, but I am essentially taking a big pay cut to move back as this new city is MUCH more expensive. My GF does not make very much and is about to take on \~40k debt to pursue a masters in the fall.

**Financial habits:** I am very frugal. Even though I make more, I take pride in building a savings account. I cook when I can and avoid large expenses unless necessary. She, on the other hand, spends quite loosely and has next to no savings.

**Now to the dog:** GF's mother bred their family dog and has held on to a puppy for a few months thinking she will give it to my GF. GF really wants to keep this puppy as she consistently visits her family home on weekends to see it. And honestly, it really is a great puppy. The issue is, I believe she is already living way above her means. She pays FAR too much for her rent, and she likes to eat out a lot. She recently signed a lease to move to a more expensive new studio apartment that does not allow dogs - instead of finding a roommate situation in a house that allows dogs.

So now, she is telling me that the dog needs to live with me. I am already struggling to find an affordable place to live in an okay area of the city - the added stress of finding a place that allows for a pet feels like way too much for me. Moreover, I don't think I can handle the financial responsibility of a dog on top of the higher cost of living and cost of moving across the country. Finally, I just don't really want a dog right now. I LOVE dogs, but now just isn't the right time for me, or honestly, for my GF.

Recently she has been having a really hard time and has blamed me for why she can't have this dog. She says that if we had decided to live together, this wouldn't be an issue, but because I wanted to wait, she is not going to be able to have the dog she wants. Do I make this sacrifice and find a way to take care of this dog for her?

**TLDR:** GF wants me to take care of a new dog for her because her apartment doesn't allow dogs - I'm hesitant because I 1.) Am about to move across the country back to her city after an LDR 2.) don't want a dog rn 3.)

relationship_advice,"Tl;dr I’m in a good spot financially and I’m officially going to be on my own in a month and a half, my girlfriend is on her own but isn’t in a great spot. We talk about moving in together but we need to agree on financial goals, and I’m not sure what those goals should be


My girlfriend and I (both 24) talk about moving in together but we both agree that we want to be smart about it financially. I’m not really sure what that means… 

We’re both from Nebraska and I’m currently doing a coop at a company in kansas, which ends this week. After that, I’ll move back in with my parents for a month and a half (to finish my CS degree) and then I’ll move back out here to start at the same company full time. I’ll be making $85k + 12k sign on bonus. I currently have $21k, with 19k of that in savings. I plan on investing $6k of the sign on bonus into VTSAX, and using another $2700 to pay off all my student loans, and maximizing my 401k which I believe the company matches 12.5%. I have no debt otherwise (outside of a CC which I always pay the day the bill is available). Up till now, my parents pay for my phone, car insurance, etc. I’m sure I’ll start paying for those things after I start my job. I use YNAB for budgeting and I’m pretty frugal and love to see my savings balance go up. 

My gf lives on her own in Nebraska, currently makes $15/hr, and has more bills than me. Her car insurance is quite expensive, she has her car payment, rent, utilities, the usual stuff. As far as I know, she doesn’t really have savings, although the only debt she has is her car. She doesn’t budget, and lives paycheck to paycheck. She doesn’t have a college degree and currently works at a preschool, so she’ll be able to find a similar job in kansas, but I’m not sure how likely a higher paying job is. 

I’m in a very good spot financially, and will continue to be so when I start the full time job, and I try to encourage my girlfriend to start budgeting so we can work towards our goals of living together and everything that comes with that. But I’m not sure what specific goals we (or she) should have to get there. A certain savings amount perhaps? What else?

relationship_advice,"I’ve known my ex for over two years, and we have dated for over 1,5 year. At first we were inseparable and loved each other to bits. But after a while we started to fight a lot more often and get more jealous, especially me. About a month ago he broke up with me, after probably the biggest fight we ever had. I can’t even remember what it was about, I just remember being so overwhelmed with anger that it didn’t even bother me that he ended things. We do still really care for eachother so we decided to stay in touch. But we soon admitted that we still had feelings for eachother. We were toxic, but we are getting better, well I tought we were. We started to spend more time together and I was convinced that we could work again. He made me believe that we would get together again but everytime I ask him how he feels about us he uses the same answer. He keeps telling me that we need to work on ouselves, whatever he means with that. I don’t understand what he wants me to change so badly, and everytime I ask him about it he starts getting mad and calls me dumb. I don’t know what he wants me to change about myself, but I would do it in a split second. Everytime we are doing better he just breaks my hearth again by telling me that we can’t get together right now. I understand that he might need time, but why does he act like he wants me back, only for him to tell me he doesn’t want me. Yesterday we got in an fight again and we’re still on weird terms now. I don’t know what to do anymore. I love him so much and I really don’t want to lose him. We’re still young but he’s the only man I see myself having a future with. I can’t lose him, it wil ruin me. But I can’t keep living in an unsure situation because it’s nerve wrecking. It’s like constantly walking on ice, I try to be so sweet and caring so maybe he will fall for me again. But once I speak up for myself he gets mad again. What should I do?

relationship_advice,"I’ve been dating this girl for months now and things are going fairly well and the relationship seems incredibly healthy. There’s just one issue. I’m a nervous wreck when it comes to sex.

I know it shouldn’t be the focal point of a healthy relationship but I’ve put it on such a large pedestal that it fucks with me. Also if you couldn’t piece it together by now I’m a virgin. My girlfriend however isn’t which I’m completely fine with the only problem is that I feel I need to live up to something. 

We get really physical really frequently. We’ve had the house to ourselves with a locked door in the dark on multiple occasions and it honestly feels insane how many opportunities I get. When things get heated it’s clear to both of us that there’s a next step we need to take. We both get really physical and she gives me so many hints but I can never bring myself to do anything better than making out. I honestly don’t want her to make the move either because I want her to be dating a man who’s confident and isn’t scared of something as insignificant as sex.

The problem is that my confidence isn’t all that terrible anymore or at least I’ve gotten good at faking it. I know she finds me attractive (and I feel the same toward her) but something blocks me every time. I always make the excuse in my head that I don’t want to do anything to make her uncomfortable but we’ve discussed over text that she has no problem with it and she’d always stop me if I did anything she wasn’t ok with. So I know, in my head, that she’s completely fine with whatever I do but I still make the excuse that I’ll make her uncomfortable or something along those lines which is entirely untrue. I tried to muster up the courage to ask for consent (in person this time) so that I’d have no excuse but I couldn’t bring myself to do that either.

I suppose I wouldn’t be having this problem if I was able to speak about the topic in person and ask her to give me some reassurance but it just seems so awkward to me and I can never think of the right words. Every time I try say something remotely sexual/romantic in person to her I end up hating the way it sounds leaving my mouth.

relationship_advice,"I’ve (F31) known Kate (F31) since elementary school. We practically lived at each other’s houses growing up, and lived together throughout college without ever getting into a fight. When she married her now soon-to-be-ex-husband (M30s), I was her maid of honor. I’m godmother/honorary aunt (since neither parent has siblings) to their daughter. We work at the same place and spend 2-3 afternoons/evenings a week together. Which is all to say: If I fuck this up, I’m destroying the closest relationship I’ve ever had, and a huge part of my family/social life.

I came out as a lesbian toward the end of college. I believed Kate was straight at the time (she was dating her now STBX husband) and was terrified that this would make some parts of our friendship seem predatory in hindsight. Sharing a bed in high school, or occasionally walking around naked if we forgot something in the shower, felt like it could read differently now. For a handful of reasons not worth unpacking in detail here (internalized homophobia, being on the ace spectrum, and a whole host of other things better suited for my therapist), I was both certain I wasn’t attracted to Kate, and terrified that people would assume otherwise. I compensated by loudly making statements like, “I’m gay, but I would NEVER be with Kate! That would be like fucking my sister!” Which was. Uncool. I had a lot of growing up to do, and sincerely thought I was being reassuring.

Just before Kate got married, she came out as bi. I made it clear that I was always there to support her, and didn’t do much work to unpack how I felt about that on my own/as a thing separate from supporting her. She was getting married, and “iT wOulD bE liKe fUckIng mY siSter.”

About 3 years ago, we did end up having a heart-to-heart about what could have been. The takeaway was essentially, “Yeah, we both kind of thought about it when we were younger, in terms of, ‘if one of us had been a boy we definitely would’ve dated.’ It was also hurtful when I said I would never date her. But it ultimately doesn’t matter because she has a family and we’ve built a friendship that’s also beautiful.”

Which is cool! Except Kate’s divorcing her husband (reasons unrelated to this), and I’m increasingly aware that whether platonic or romantic, she’s my life partner. And holy shit, how amazing would it be to be able to cuddle on the couch with her while we watch our shows, or hold hands when we go on adventures together, or wake up next to each other? She’s insanely creative, brilliant, amazing at reading people, and feels more like home than any physical place ever could. 

My biggest concerns are:
1.	What if she thinks I only feel this way because I’m still single at 31? I’ve had crushes on various people but they either fizzled out or ended with the other person not feeling the same way. I don’t want her to feel like a back-up plan, just because nothing else panned out. It’s way too intense to say out loud, but there’s part of me that wants very much to convey somewhere down the line that, “It’s always been you, I was just a huge ding dong about it.”
2.	Maybe it’s too soon since she separated from her husband? It’s been over a year, and I’d planned to wait until she officially divorced him. But she mentioned recently that she met up with an ex for lunch a few weeks ago, and that he was very clearly interested in her/how nice it felt to be wanted, even though she didn’t plan to reciprocate. Now I’m worried that I might wait so long that I lose my chance entirely.

I know the answer is, essentially, “Tell her!” I know I really, really should. We’re already tentatively talking about maybe moving in together in a year or two, depending on how things go financially/socially. It would be unfair NOT to tell her. But I also struggle to “just” tell people things, even when they’re less loaded than this. I usually look up examples of ways to open up a difficult conversation, but there aren’t exactly guides along the lines of, “Talking about a relationship you torpedoed out of Gay Panic before it could even start…For Dummies!” Honestly, any specific talking points, phrasing…anything would be helpful.

relationship_advice,"Hi Reddit, throwaway because my main account had my name in it and I don't want it traced back to me.

My S/O and I have been dating for 6 months now, and she's a great girl inside and out. She's got looks, ambition, is supportive, all the good stuff you would look to find in a partner. Thing is, I'm not falling in love with her. I'm trying to find out if this is something I should work through and make work, or if I should cut my losses and break it off. She's by no means perfect, sometimes making plans with her is like pulling teeth, even something as simple as getting dinner (she's really picky), we get into petty fights that turn into arguments, and she's insecure which leads into jealousy. However, if I were to want to get married to someone, she's the type of person I think I would want to marry. I would never have to worry about her cheating on me, and she's all of the things mentioned above as well. 

Thing is, as mentioned above I'm not falling in love with her. I don't get super excited to see her, I don't ""love"" the time that we spend together even though we do have fun. Additionally, I was having a lot more fun when I was single. I mean that ""figuratively"" and literally. I'm also in a point of my life where I want to build myself even further than I am now, and I view her as a distraction if I'm being honest. I'm also not being everything I feel I should be for her. I work a high stress job, which makes me not the most affectionate person on the planet. Which I think somewhat ties back into the ""not falling in love"" issue too. I don't think she's ticking all of my boxes, but the ones she is has me second guessing myself on if I need to stick it out

I'm very unsure if I'm being pig headed and need to get my head out of my ass, of if my feelings or lack there of are valid enough for me to call it off. If so, then how? I care about her, and when I came close to doing it it was one of the most emotionally wrecking experiences for both of us. It hurt me to see how much I was hurting her when we had ""the talk"" So Reddit, any advice would be appreciated.

When i met her i described it like imprinting (from twilight, what the wolves do) anyway, everything seemed great. Never got into fights never even argued. Then around 2 weeks ago i was at a family thing and supposed to go see her afterward. I was drinking alcohol and got a little tooo drunk to drive so my brother took the car home. I , after making myself throw up felt better, and after a couple of prompts from her over text called an uber and went to her grand parents house. And before you ask i wasn't falling over myself drunk, the buzz i had was going away, anyway i get there say hi to everyone and then I'm sitting on the couch and ask her if I could take a nap. she agreed and i slept for around 30 mins on said couch. I felt completely fine no problems. About an hour later she makes me call an uber and i go home. right away she's short with me and kinda rude over text. I start to get panicky, (unresolved issues from a past relationship) and beginning to hyper ventilate, shake, and cry. I calm myself down and she says i'm unstable and that we need time apart. we're still together but on a break. that was roughly 2 weeks ago. I kept trying to reach out, having quit drinking alcohol, pop, caffeine, and anything with processed sugars, they're bad for me. anyway she tells me that she needs more time. I then don't message her for a week and finally i resolve today to go see her. I need answers, i have literally no idea how she feels or what she's doing. so i drive there resolving to say listen if you want out of the relationship but you don't have the balls to do it then i'm giving you this out. well her dad answers the door and tells me she's not home. this turns out to be a lie. But anyway I leave and get home and she texts me basically saying that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me or anyone else. She's done and has been for a little while now.

It took weeks because we would schedule time to talk but he would be too busy. 

Weeks later he approached me about a Fwb relationship. I initially said no but slipped up a couple of times because I missed him. After I realized what a mental mess it could be I told him I didn’t want fwb because I wanted a relationship. I told him that we should stop communicating.

* TLDR 
* I still live with my mom and she's ok with that as long as i help out 
* I'm autistic so I don't understand instructions/chores the way she wants me to and always blames me for getting it wrong
* She told me that she would try and communicate better
* She said when I was struggling in school that my learning disability was no excuse and that sent me into a spiral I just got out of 
* I told her that and she called me a manipulative bitch 

&amp;#x200B;

I still live with my mom, and she's okay with that as long as I help around the house. But I'm autistic and I don't process information/instructions the same way as she does, which makes it really hard for us to communicate, because I'm always doing things wrong-the thing is, I think I'm doing it right because I'm doing it the way it makes sense to me. I told her that I need her to explain things in a way I understand. Then she said she would. We've always been fighting over my autism and learning disability which makes school, among other things, extremely difficult for me. 

She told me when I was 15 that ""my learning disability isn't an excuse"" and that sent me down a spiral through my teenage years where I felt so stupid that I would start crying in class. And she still never understood. I was lucky enough to get academic support from some amazing and patient teachers, but she was never a support for me. 

I told her that, and she said I was a ""manipulative bitch"" and she's called me that so many times that I didn't even cry the night it happened. I told her that I decided when I was 15, after she said the ""no excuses"" thing to me, ""that if my relationship with my mom isn't going to work out, I'll just try and be nice to my friends and be a good person."" She's always saying I'm the only one in her life that she fights with. And it's because of the fact that she never understood. She's also the only one I fight with, because she's the only person who doesn't get it. I refuse to feel stupid again and I'm on a healing/unlearning journey with that.

relationship_advice,"My bf / fiance of 8 (sort of 9 ) years broke up with me a few weeks ago. It absolutely broke my heart and he says he just wants space and wants to talk to other ppl. our living situation isnt ideal its kind of a mess and a lot of it is not within our control so its just been a terrible enviornment not a good place for a thriving relationship. but i found out a few days ago that he was reaching out to girls for a three some and flirting with girls 4 years ago when we had a long distance for 6 months. he said he never actually did anything physical but after all this time to find this out.....it hurts. i feel liek ive been so lied to. i also found out he has already reached out to so many girls , has tinder, and many other dating sites, he constantly looks at porn , ( says he doesnt but ik he does). he did this before i even got a chance to move out....im crushed that we still lay in the same bed and he expects us to have sex yet he reaches out to other girls telling them some pretty dirty things then tells me he hasnt talked to anyone and that its not true. he only admitted it when i finally told him i looked thru his phone and  i know hes lying. 

anyway.....firstly, im so so so sad and if he told me lets forget it all and try again, i would forgive him. this isnt a ""girl just forget about him"" thing. this is 9 ish years of living together, traveling, doing everything together. im so attatched. i was 16 when we first started dating. i cant imagine life wihtout him. 

secondly. he says he wants space and to talk to other ppl. and yet he still says he wants to just be my friend and invites me to some cute events and stuff..... i want to say yes and go with him to these events it sounds so nice but also it probably makes me more attatched and makes the break u p harder. 

im having so much trouble accepting that he wants other girls. im having so much trouble moving on and ik he already has mentally moved on.  im having trouble staying away bc i love him but i feel stupid that im just one of many. im having trouble trusting him and anything he says at this point........... im so hurt i havent stopped crying in days . i constantly cry. cant even order a damn coffee with out crying.  i feel devistated. my heart hurts. im struggling so much its affecting my  ability to focus on school, my health, my hobbies.......",0,I feel so crushed from my breakup its ruining my day every day (im 25f hes 29m),r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8871070,1682542990,0,1682543002,1682543002,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,17,467

relationship_advice," 

A couple of weeks ago, my boyfriend was drinking in his room with his friends. He only drinks occasionally, and it has never produced a problem of this magnitude. He does take medications that may interact negatively with alcohol. One of his friends invited a mutual female friend. I actually met my boyfriend through this girl when the two of them were close. I ended up having a significant conflict with this girl that left us estranged, and my boyfriend had not closely associated with her for a while either. My boyfriend and his friends were all super drunk. As the girl described, he was ""super super trashed"" and ""groped her a few times"". There were other people in the room, but no real witnesses because of their excessive drinking.

This girl has a history of sexual trauma, and so in addition to the normal damaging effect of this event, she was incredibly distraught and felt extremely violated as she was forced to relive her experiences. However, she limited the amount of people she told about this event, with the plan to simply move on and not associate with my boyfriend anymore. Apparently she was extremely traumatized by this event, according to the people she initially told (I was not one of them). About two weeks went by before people that she had told about this in confidence spread the news of the event, and now everyone knows, including me. I did speak to her directly about it, but when she spoke to she simply discussed how uncomfortable the event had made her feel, but that she didn't consider it assault, and she didn't even think that he remembered. She may be downplaying the event, or maybe time changed her perspective, I'm not sure. I confronted my boyfriend the day I heard and broke up with him, but he had no idea what I was talking about. He genuinely has no memory of this event and I believe him, but that doesn't change what he did. Now everyone knows, and believes that he is some sort of sex pest at best, and a sexual predator at worst.

He has fully owned up to his actions, apologized, and considers what he did assault. He now struggles heavily with people seeing him as a sexual predator over something he does not remember. He has stopped drinking entirely, and is working on getting sober from weed as well. I love him very much, but he was not a perfect boyfriend. We had been having problems that we were working out up until this event. However, I struggle with my decision to dump him, because it doesn't feel like he ""chose"" to do this horrific thing. He is genuinely remorseful and doesn't even remember it. I broke up with him largely due to social pressure, as I was being considered the enabler of some sort of sexual abuser. However, I ultimately think that this characterization of him, and me by extension if I choose to stay with him, is not right or fair.

If I did date him again, he would no longer be welcome in spaces shared with this girl (a standard that I would enforce) for her comfort. However, I may also have to step away from these spaces, as well as earn the ire of my classmates. In addition, my two close friends would severely disapprove of my decision to date him again, if they choose to maintain their relationship with me at all. They described that they would ""see me differently"". Leaving him would be the most socially convenient thing to do, but it is not what I want to do. But I recognize that I'm 20 and have my whole life to live, and he is just one guy. I worry that if I choose to date him and we don't work out, I will regret the way this choice will have damaged my other relationships. What should I do?

Separately, his actions were infidelitous, but I truly believe that there is no set of circumstances where they would repeat, especially as long as he stays sober, which is a requirement for us to continue our relationship. The biggest sticking point here is that in the past he had requested to remain on dating apps, as long as we weren't talking to other people. I agreed because we both like swiping on apps for fun. He would even let me see his app. We are bi4bi, so he was on grindr and i was on the HER app. However, I discovered that he was talking to people on the app more than I was comfortable with, although he had never met anyone. We initially broke up, but I let it slide because he has a lot of internalized homophobia and struggles with his relationship with men. We reestablished boundaries and were rebuilding trust and were actually really happy, and then this assault event occurred. Technically, he is out of chances, but I feel conflicted. He was making a lot of consistent effort and improvement in our relationship. He has always prioritized consent in our relationship. This incident genuinely seems unlike him, and we were doing so well.

Am I wrong to consider getting back with him?

relationship_advice,"I and my bf were in a 7.5 year long relationship out of which 4 years were ldr. 

How funny it is to find so many differences between a couple after 7.5 years of courtship. I used to wonder always why people breakup after 11+ years of togetherness. But you get the answer once you experience it by yourself. I am not saying that love can only happen between two identical souls rather love is not defined by anything. **It is the most easiest yet beautiful experience you ever get without any cost.** But it doesn't comes that easy. You know, every single human is **different** on genetic level. **So when love hits you both,  both of you have to forget the differences to make love win lest differences will eat out that love.** Sometimes it happens that in 7 years, differences won't knock your door and you will continue the courtship but that's not necessary that if you lived happily for 7 years, you will always live like this. If differences popped up which you both were suppressing by your love then friction will develop which will ignite separation in both of you or at least in one of you.  
So question is why it happens that in 7 years those differences didn't rise but it came all of a sudden and is creating separation? It comes when one of your partner or both of you aren't mentally stable. You might have heard "" negativity comes to emotionally weak person"" similarly differences gets more prioritised when you are emotionally sensitive and mentally weak for a while. Love makes you do anything and it makes you strong so that you both can overcome obstacle together but when one of you starts nitpicking, differences gets strength and you get vulnerable and weak and love from your side becomes weak too. At this point, the relationship continues single handedly by one partner until his/her patience level gets crossed seeing you nitpicking and not interested anymore...BOOM, break up!  
Now if you know that it's happening to you then its better to make yourself strong enough by any means to continue that love. Seek therapy, communicate with your better half, visit relationship counsellor and whatever you feel right. Many people don't do this maybe because they feel heavy putting efforts in bad mental state but whatever i have seen our generation not putting much effort to save that beautiful love by making yourself strong which will suppress the differences. In my case, communicating with my boyfriend failed and i dont have anywhere to go to seek help. So i just broke off because i dont want him to suffer anymore because i have started seeing differences between us and am unable to get strong to overcome the differences. Its a very weird situation where i am crying my heart out to bring him back but am unable to stop nitpicking and giving priority to differences. I am depressed, taking medications too and all this depression in reflecting on my relationship. My boyfriend was my life, a reason to live and get better but i broke up because i love him so much that i don't want him to suffer.Thing is he didn't even broke up with me, i am the one who blocked him from everywhere and i don't live near him so yeah he cannot contact me. I gave him excuses that i will find a man who is a doppleganger of me (not physically) but i know it's nearly impossible. It might seem that he is the one but dude, people literally take 7 years to realise how different they both are and breaking up after so long hurts a lot. I am feeling so suicidal but idk what to do. I dont want to hurt him by arguing regularly by nitpicking something and he dont even argue, he just sits and tries to calm me down. I wish that he get a best girl .

My first ever post, I haven’t really got anyone to talk to about this so I thought maybe let it out here.

My GF (25) of four years broke up with me (25)… me and my ex met at University, we were not so close friends, but after a few dates and nights out we ended up starting a relationship. 

The first two years were amazing, we were happy got along and everything was perfect, I really thought she was the one, I’ve been in a couple superficial relationships before but this was my first “real” meaningful one. 

The 2nd/3rd year was during COVID and she ended up moving back to Greece where she’s from, as the Universities closed and we couldn’t complete our Masters, she couldn’t afford to stay in the UK otherwise, and I went back to living with my mother. 
As a result we were in a long distance relationship and it put a huge strain on us! We went from rarely ever arguing to arguing almost every single day. When she finally came back I found out that a friend of hers had set her up with another guy while she was there, they had gone out, kissed and she had sent him semi-explicit images. 
This broke me, but I tried to justify it being because of the distance and the constant arguing… I forgave her and we moved on, though looking back I became a lot more insecure within the relationship after this. 

After some months of living in student accommodation, things had gone almost back to normal, we were happy and the fights stopped… she mentioned her parents were struggling to support her and her job wasn’t enough to cover rent and expenses. We were both working part time while finishing our degrees. So I suggested we both move into my  mothers house. (This was the beginning of the end)

While it started well, we had made plans to use the time to save money and plan a future together… however, her moving in quickly became a huge mistake. My mother made our lives difficult and fights with my gf became a regular occurrence.  

A little while later, my mother had come upon a puppy at her job that was in need of a home and asked if I wanted it. 
My gf always dreamed of having dogs, she loved dogs but never actually had one, so we agreed and thought it would be nice for us to have a puppy together. This only made things more difficult, my gf had put the puppy first above anything else. She was less affectionate and her entire identity became the dog, and we fought even more as I was not the same.

After a year of this, our relationship was dying, she no longer really cared about us. The only time we really had fun was when we went out to monthly events for our dog. We’d get home and things seemed better for a little while. Seeing her care less and less only made me more insecure, it made me try grasp at anything to revive our relationship but this only pushed her away more. 

Finally, we both finished our degrees and I started working full time, while she was looking for jobs. We had planned to move out and things looked better. Her mother pressured her to move back to Greece till she found a job, this lasted 5 months till she found one, however, we fought again for the final time just before she was due to return, then messaged me that she wanted to break up and it was over. 

She initially suggested to try be friends and to avoid having a bad break up. But every time we’ve spoken since it’s been nothing but arguments. 

I needed to get this of my chest. This was my first long term relationship, and I never expected it to end even after all our issues. I hate myself for the decisions I’ve made, for the stupid arguments we had.

• I always call them first which he says is because he doesn't want to call me while l'm with my parents or I'm by doings something important.

I appreciate it but I have told to him that I would like it if he called me first but he still hasn't...

• We've never met in person, except the first time we saw each other at an event, and he asked for my number

• We go to different schools

• He's very respectful towards me, every time we (FaceTime) I never question if he likes me or not..

• he has asked me to be his girlfriend, but I told him that let's meet up in person, on a date and then we can decide because the feeling was mutual.

So here's what happened

we're on the phone and he tells me that he's unable to take me to prom because everybody else is ready for it. he mentions renting a car and expensive dress/suit and that he's just not prepared. (Prom was 20 days away) and I understand that.

A couple days ago, he slips out and tells me that he's going to go with his friends. Am I wrong for being upset? He doesn't want to take me but wants to go on his own??",0,"The guy 18M I'm talking to said he can't take me 18F to prom, then he later tell me his going on his own.. am I wrong for being upset?",r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8870995,1682542340,0,1682542351,1682542352,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,30,246

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I sometimes work together when we don't have a lot of time. For context, we have been dating two years. A few days ago, he came over while I was on Zoom meetings and sat with me. I'm in uni and I'm currently going through finals. We went to lunch at a place a block away from my home (a really good restaurant with a world famous chef,) and my boyfriend seemed anxious. I asked him what was wrong and he told me he had a headache. The music was kind of loud at the restaurant, so we left early. When we got back to my place, I gave him some advil and a drink. I got back to working on my laptop and he sat with me on my porch. He was stretching and I asked him what was wrong (he has some sports injuries and I give him massages often, actually while I was on my Zoom meeting I turned my camera off and massaged his legs,) and he said his stomach hurt and asked for alkaline seltzer. I told him I didn't have any but I did have a probiotic (I take one sometimes when my digestive system starts getting funny). He told me he had some work at home and he'd stop to get some tummy meds on the way. We kissed goodbye and he left. 

The next day, he didn't answer my calls or texts. We've been dating for two years and I have never asked him for anything other than 1) flowers on my birthday and 2) a text or call every day. I'm really low maintenance, I pay for meals, I get him more gifts than he does me. I told him the daily text can be something as simple as an emoji if he was busy. Well, two days passed and he said nothing to me. I texted; I called. I asked if he was okay--no answer. I turned in my assignment (it's finals week,) and drove over to his house at around 10 pm. 

I saw he was okay, said that's all I was there for, and went to leave. He asked me to stay, so I did. He said something was weird when we went out to eat and it's like I didn't even notice. I literally asked him if he was okay, what he had been doing and thinking about. He had a headache, his tummy hurt... He acted like I was never there for him and I just didn't understand and didn't care. He says we don't talk about things a lot anymore, but that's literally his fault. I ask him what he's done today with the cameras (he works in media,) and he has told me it's weird that I want to know and that I should know. I ask him other questions about family and he says those are too personal. He complained that it's like I don't even know him. He complained that he doesn't know what I'm like when he's not around. I told him he'd have these struggles with anyone. But, how am I supposed to be there for someone when they won't even let me know they're still  alive over text? I told him I just wanted to make sure he didn't slip in the shower and die or something and I would have stayed home if I didn't care. 

He complained that our relationship isn't progressing, but he won't be vulnerable with me. I've told him before I make any big steps (like kids--he wants kids,) he has to be open with me. He won't even tell me how much money he makes and I have let him know that I would have to know if we made any life decisions together, like buying a home or having kids. He complains I don't have time to travel, but he does not aim to plan anything. I've told him you'll have to plan with anyone because people have to take off work. He also is not interested in financially providing, which is fine as I don't want to be dependent on someone. But, I can't be always available and have my own stuff going on--that's a reality. He complained that one of my side projects (an art project for a client who is gracious in letting me take my time,) isn't progressing. That has actually nothing to do with him, for one. But, two: I ask about his projects and he gives me standard answers and doesn't want to talk about it.

This all started in November when we did a job together. He brought up how I had said no to doing a full file transfer on his laptop (I did not feel comfortable doing a full transfer of his footage--I didn't know if he wanted it imported into any software or anything, and it would just be faster if he did it. He's said that me saying no still bothers him. He did the transfer and lost all the footage because the equipment he purchased was incompatible. He said something about how it was my job to know something was wrong--I have never done anything technical in the field and was strictly there to assist. I know nothing about cameras and chip speeds or processors. The most technical jobs I've ever done was art direction or things to do with photoshop. It was his responsibility to know something was wrong with the equipment that he purchased at his own company. The site was an hour away from the nearest store and there was nothing I could have done if I did know something was wrong. And, him doing the transfer was the only reason he knew I had pressed record. If I had done it, it would have been that I lost all of that work. He had no reason to believe I was capable of knowing that and I have refused to do another job for him. The client was his sibling, and she screamed, I mean SCREAMED at him for WEEKS over this. Would just call him and scream. Literally. 

I think he is re-directing his feelings about his family to me. His sibling yelling at him and the feelings that caused got re-routed to me simply saying no to a very small task. He hates doing things around my house with me ever since his parents, a couple of slumlords, evicted everyone and are making him redo the houses. I have come to the conclusion that he is financially dependent on his family, and his family has really sunk their claws in since November. His sibling also raised hell and got rid of all of my bf's employees and he can't confront that. His mom has insulted me in front of him and in private and he does not believe a couple comments she made to me when I let him know. His mom had him give me a used, ripped up, fake Michael Kors bag for my birthday. I speak people with p\*\*\*\*, I know that means ""f\*\*\* you."" 

He complained that I don't do anything with him and that I don't listen. I don't like to go to super loud events when my ears are messed up, and I have bad ears, so I often ask him to repeat things. We have already argued about this and I have already told him it's not that I'm not listening and don't care. I have ears so bad I couldn't hear for weeks after a plane ride one time (fluid filled my ears.) But, I ask him to come with me to things all the time, every evening or Saturday I have available, even if it means shoving other things to the side. He hasn't taken me on a nice date since November.

I used to model and magazines/newspapers still print my face even though I stopped years ago. I feel ugly all the time but I know that most people find me really pretty. I get asked out often and I have been offered free vacations and not taken them. My boyfriend has the nerve to wonder out loud if I'm using him when he didn't get me anything for my birthday last year, never buys me things, and had repeatedly stated that he won't support me. Why would I have stayed for two years? I have spent hundreds on Christmas and his birthday--for Christmas I spent days custom making something for his parents' home (and included a store-bought gift). Meanwhile he has purchased me things I have explicitly stated I don't want, aren't compatible with my phone, or brought me things that are literally ripped up. I know it's not that I'm dishonest, I know that it's not that I'm high maintenance or dramatic, and I know it's not because I'm unattractive. I'm not a mind reader and i can't help someone who won't even speak to me. 

Anyways, I know the thing to do is break up with him, but I want to give him another chance first, I know. I'm just not in a state where I want to break up and this is the first time I've ever been attracted to someone and even considered a long-term relationship. How do I tell him he needs to get his s\*\*\* together, stop re-directing other problems onto me (first I have to get him to see that he is doing that), or I am leaving? It's just that every problem he says he has with me is an issue he would have with literally any woman, or he is the source of the problem? (For example, saying we don't have conversations when I try so hard to keep conversations going.) I can't get it through to him that I'm not gonna have his kids if I can't even get a text back.

relationship_advice,"I want to start this off by saying I feel HORRIBLE. I am not trying to make excuses to make myself look better, and regardless I know I'm going to live with the guilt of this my whole life. A couple of days ago I, and an old ""situationship""/ current friend got extremely drunk together. He made a move on me and to be quite honest I don't remember a lot of it but I remember kissing him before passing out on his couch. He has a very naturally flirty personality and when he was flirting with me before we got drunk laughed it off cause he knows about my BF and vice versa and we have not done anything with each other since I have been in a relationship. 
I have never cheated on anyone before and I know I never will again, it's just tough to tell my BF this because his ex-GFs were serial cheaters (he has been cheated on around 8/9 times) and I know it will be hard for him to believe that I had no ill intent at all and do not genuinely remember most of the interaction. We are also living together soon and have a year long lease signed together starting in September and I don't want to ruin our relationship (even though I fear I already have). 
My BF is one of the sweetest and most patient people I know, and I genuinely want to spend the rest of my life with him, so I don't want to ruin his view on the world by destroying his trust in me. Should I tell him or should live with the guilt of this horrible action for the rest of my life?

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend (26m) and I (23f) have officially been together since December, but we started dating in late August and exclusive since late September. His last serious relationship was a long distance relationship in 2021 for about 10 months where he dated a girl who he dated for 2 years in high school (his sister and his ex's sister are best friends, so they will almost definitely be in indirect communication for life even if they don't talk). It also hurts because she broke up with him, not the other way around.

Around October we were talking about baby names (ik ik too soon, it was just for fun, not serious. obviously not having a baby any time soon). He said two girl names that had the same ending (think like Brianna and Lianna), claiming that he just thought they were pretty. At the time I thought nothing of it because they were fairly common names and nothing too unique. A month later, we finally added each other on instagram (and as someone who has experienced light retroactive jealousy before, I knew I was gonna feel bad that day no matter what). That was when I realized his last ex was named Brianna (names changed for obv reasons) because he had photos still up on his instagram of JUST HER- not even them together or in a group. Photos he took of her with flowers/in parks, when just that weekend he had taken photos of me with flowers/ in parks. I immediately started crying (with him in the room) and freaked out and he asked if I was ok. That day, I didn't talk about it. But a few days later I did and I started crying. He totally agreed that it was weird of him to say her name for a baby but that it didn't mean anything, it was just a name, and he had liked the name before he dated her (but they started dating in hs in 2013 so? what is ""before""?). He apologized.

I couldn't stop thinking about it though, and I brought it up a few weeks later and then again a month and a half after that. Each time he has continued to reassure me that he has no feelings for her, he even blocked her on instagram, deleted her number, said ""I don't even like that name anymore because of all the problems it's caused,"" he understood how uncomfortable it was for me, and apologized time and time again. He said I can bring it up as many times as I need to because he always wants me to feel secure. He deleted all the photos of her off his instagram too (except for one but it was small from almost 10 years ago so I think he just missed it). He also told me that his first high school girlfriend had the same name as this girl (it's fairly common where he grew up), just spelled differently, which I wasn't sure if it was supposed to make me feel better or worse? Lol.

I know that he has basically done everything right to resolve this. But I just can't stop wondering WHY anyone would even say their ex's name (let alone 2 exes' names?) as a potential baby name. It drives me crazy even 7 months after.

relationship_advice,"I've been dating my boyfriend, Carlos, for about 2.5 years, and in a lot of ways we've flourished together. However, there's also been a lot of tumult (he cheated back we first started dating, I had a mental health crisis last year that impacted the relationship), and after this weekend we're considering breaking up. I need a bit of outside perspective, and since I can't get in with my therapist right now I figured I'd ask the internet.

This past weekend was my birthday, and my boyfriend and I, plus several of our friends, were going to a comic convention to party and celebrate. Carlos' friend, Maria, reached out because she was in town for an extended visit, so he invited her along. Maria is visiting the US (they're both from South America) for a couple of months because she just broke up with her boyfriend and is looking to escape the heartbreak, in her words. 

The rest of the group was planning costumes to wear, so a couple of days before the con, which was the day I met her, I asked him if she might want to borrow something from me. He replied they wouldn't fit because her boobs are ""out to here"" (I'm not very well endowed), and then said ""she's really hot, she'll look great in just jeans and a tank top."" He even pulled up her Instagram to show me a photo of her in a tight, low cut dress to prove it.

I got quite drunk at the party, and after a couple of incidents where I felt ignored by him, I blew up over the whole thing in the hallway, asking him why he couldn't be more considerate towards my feelings if he really loved me (while sobbing rather hysterically, I should add; I wasn't what you'd call ""composed"" at the moment). Eventually he apologized, I calmed down, and we moved on, but after the weekend we decided to take a break to sort out our feelings.

He was upset that I still didn't trust him, and in a sense, I see where he's coming from - we've spent a lot of time trying to rebuild trust, and it's not like he's being shady or sneaky, just honest, in his mind. Both of us sometimes check out or even comment on attractive women (I'm bi), so it's not like it's a hard boundary for us. I also know that the mature way to handle this would have been to be direct, not to snap at him in front of everyone and then run out of the room.

That said, one of our longstanding issues is that I tend to be jealous or suspicious of his female friends, and I honestly don't feel unreasonable about it. Several of them are former FWBs, and I was kind of weirded out one time to discover that every woman at a gathering had slept with him. The person that he cheated on me with was someone that he at first just described as a friend (and yes, he cut off contact after the incident). I need to be able to tell myself that he's not interested in them in any way, and that's harder to do when he's sort of obvious about lusting after someone else. Not to be petty, but she probably wouldn't have even pinged my insecurities if he hadn't been so emphatic about her hotness - she's cute, but not the 11/10 that I was expecting from his description. 

I feel like the obvious answer is to break up and find someone that I'm more compatible with, but I just don't want to. I love him, I love our life, and the thought of ending things makes me unbearably sad. How can I communicate to him that this hurt me, and why this hurt me, without making him feel like an untrustworthy cad?

relationship_advice,"My husband is a scientist and started working only in the past year - before that he studied for more than 10 years. His parents supported him and I earned money so we were always financially well.

About 1 year ago I moved to another country where we agreed to move together - then he decided to stay in his home country to work for a year and learn the language so he can work here. We both went through this one year quite successfully, except that he could not learn the language. About a year ago he started complaining that he won't learn the language and that he won't be able to find a job - and he started heavily relying on me by complaining about this over and over and over again. I am a successful investment banker and also a very devoted partner - I visit him every month, I cook for him, clean his house, I take care of him as a wife.  He lives with parents now as we saw no reason to rent a flat for him for this 1 year before he moves in with me abroad. I know it is hard for him to live with them because they're kind of cray-cray and his family has huge screaming arguments regularly.

Until recently I was always supportive but I cannot tolerate the nagging anymore, it is going on for a year and I realized that most probably this bothers me on top of other things I tried not to acknowledge.

* He is extremely dependent on his parents - they are involved in every decision, every step on the way and have an opinion on everything. He seems less bothered by it but I am chocked and started to express this recently. He is protecting me 100%, he has no problem leaving them or put them to their place, but still the fact that they are so strong-opinionated doesn't bother him. We had one time that he started crying because his parents went on his nerves regarding his career for ages but by then I hated his parents so I could not accept their apology.
* My husband had around 10 months - 1 year when he woke up every night at the middle of the night because of his medical problem. We went to the hospital because of it several times, even abroad in several countries we traveled to. It had a huge impact on our relationship as he was constantly nervous and anxious and he kept getting panic attacks. It got so bad that I literally could not stay awake during my days at work and had to have midday naps. My main problem that he was never really doing any actions other than complaining and going to the hospital to solve it, though they told him that therapy could help as well as medication, he refused it for about 1 year. Since then he went to therapy maybe 5 times and after taking the pill for some months this condition is mostly gone, but still makes me wonder what if we'll have children and he'll have it again, can I even rely on him that he won't cause me extra sleepless nights and several running to the hospital in a week.
* He is extremely stubborn and demeaning sometimes - whenever I have an opinion different from his, he tells me I am wrong and my opinion is wrong. He thinks he can be objective and he knows best, he tells me I have bad memory and sometimes he even manipulates me. I told him countless of times that I hate when he tells me I am wrong, because it is just an opinion, we're not arguing about facts here, he still seems to not understand it and puts me down.
* He heavily relies on me with finding on a job in the country I currently live in - I already helped him to write his CV, 2 motivational letters, searched on the internet but he still tells me, it's me who should do more. I did not build a successful circle in his field because I am an investment banker and he's a scientist so I had no chance, but I went online to apply for him for jobs, I researched language schools, I paid half of the school fees, I regularly visit our religious circle here. I did all I could do in a new country within 1 year, I even have local friends but he still doesn't seem to understand that I can't provide a job for him - he needs to speak the language first. I feel like he's blaming me to push the responsibility off of himself. I am afraid if he cannot do this, how can I rely him later on in life.
* Since about 3 years he loses erection during sex and I have to make him hard again - I know that it started with his anxiety regarding his scientific studies and I was really patient with him for a long time. I just have the feeling that either he was never really attracted to me or he has ED because it's not common that a man has no standing erection for this long.
* He was never really a problem solver. At the beginning I found it fascinating how he has a guy to call for everything, and how nice that he calls his parents so often, by today I am going nuts about it. He speaks on the phone with his parents several times a day when they're apart, they share every tiny thing, he answers the phone calls during the date etc. And he just never learned how to solve a task alone, he relies on me with everything! He never sits down to check something he doesn't know on the internet, he expects me to do it for him. This is seriously turning me off. 

I am starting to lose faith in our marriage. I am very happy to be alone in my apartment, I am happy to go out with my friends and to go visit my parents once every 2 months as they live in my home country, I love my job and the country I live in. I feel that all these problems and the fact that I have to solve it made me his mom and not his wife - I quite frankly lost a lot of attraction towards him because of this. Every day I work around incredibly capable and talented people and my clever and amazing husband doesn't seem to be able to solve basic problems and it's turning me off so badly... 

Is there a comeback from this?

relationship_advice,"My girlfriend has been depressed for some years now, her mother was diagnosed with cancer when my gf was 8 and died 2 years ago. She's tried going to psychologists but unfortunately they have been the exact opposite of what she needs and has therefore got a negative experience/attitude against therapy.

We have been able to talk somewhat about things and I've been trying my best to make her feel more happy but it's clear i can't uphold that for very long periods of time. 

Lately she's gotten the feeling that we're stuck in life and not going forward in any way, even though we got a new apartment and a dog about 2 1/2 years ago. I just recently got a new nice job and we're making good money and are therefo6now in the market for a new house, everything is moving along nicely. 

There is constantly talk about how i haven't proposed yet, which tbf maybe is overdue but since there for the last 3 years had been talks/almost begging for it at least every week, it just doesn't seem like it would be my genuine wish but more so to please her. I love her very much and if there wouldn't have been constant talk about it i probably already would have.

Now we are at a stage where her depression is worse than ever and I'm starting to feel down as well since we fight so often. I try to do everything in my power to make her feel better but it always seems like it isn't enough because it's not a proposal/house/baby. I'm feeling very powerless yet she always says that we are in a situation where i have all the power bc i can propose or I can say ""let's have a kid"" and she would say yes. (Even though it probably isn't a good idea and wouldn't solve anything at all). 

I'm trying to Explain to her that every thing has its place and time and that we should take one thing at a time. But since we aren't finding any houses she now wants to make plans/determine when what's gonna happen and make sure we are going in that we are going in that direction at all time. 

I just feel like any the only reasonable thing is to do it a bit more slow (my way) but she just feels like i am doubting our relationship and postponing things (which i kinda am bc the not so good place we're at). This just makes it worse and i get stressed out. At the same time i really understand her point of view, and i honestly would love all of that aswell but I'd like us to be in a more stable place, which we might not be able to be since we are fighting over when to do all those things.

Of course it's frustrating aswell for her that we are in ""different places"" in life but we probably wouldn't have been unless there was so much talking nagging about all those things which kinda makes this  a vicious circle that just tears on both of our mental health.

I honestly don't know what to do and I don't expect anyone to read this at all but I just had to let some of it out somewhere.

(Sorry for the essay TLDR at end) I (26f) have been with my bf (30m) for 2 years now. 
B/G Context: When we first started hanging out before we started dating I made a stupid joke about how I find feet repulsive because i was a ballerina and most of our feet are gross due to the abuse they take. After we started dating I found out my bf has a foot fetish and was put off of getting with me because he knows I hate feet. I was mainly insecure at first because after years of dancing mine are not pretty to say the least. He never seemed interested in doing footstuff with me we tried a couple times but I wasn’t very good and was conscious and he didn’t seem into it it’s been a while since he’s expressed any desire to. 
I borrowed his phone the other day as mine was plugged into the speaker while we were getting ourselves ready to go out I was doing my makeup and took one look at my face and decided I wanted to buy one of those pore vacuumes  that are all over TikTok I borrowed his phone to Google them and obviously I got to ""por…“ before I realised what most of the results that had already been searched were. These were the results that show because they’re most visited links btw. The results brought up pornhub as the most visited site and then links that he most Frequently clicks. I have no problem with porn and watch it myself sometimes but I have some absolute no go blacklisted categories that for me are a big no as I personally take issue with them. Other people watching them gives me the ick but it’s their choice to do what they like I just never thought it would hit so close to home with it being my boyfriend being this  type of person. His most visited links were ""petite teen"" and ""family"" like step sister/ step mum type of stuff. Foot stuff obviously which was not a surprise but it was all ""ebony"" too. Every.single.link. I felt disgusted that he was watching teen porn as a 30 year old man it screams creep to me. The family stuff I think is weird but that wasn’t the biggest issue. The foot stuff I obviously knew about. I’m also very concerned that all of his porn is black teen porn. The porn industry can be incredibly racist and exploitive and with a lot of the trafficking of young girls especially poc I find this superfucked up that it’s even a category people would watch especially my seemingly regular noncreepy boyfriend. How do I talk to him about this and express how uncomfortable I am ? It’s made me not want to be touched by him and I can’t look at him the same I need a way to discuss why he’s into these themes that are boardering on wrong. I don’t know how to verbalise to him what the problem is without him getting his back up as he is a poor communicator at the best of times.

relationship_advice,"This might be a long one, but it's also my first post on Reddit. I'll try to keep it as simple as possible. I 21F and my bf 23M have been together for 2.5 years. When we first met, I was living alone in my apartment and was new to the state (I had escaped my abductor and a bunch of crazy events, thus moved out of state for safety). He grew up here and had a very stable life, whereas my life was much crazier &amp; traumatic. I think of him as an angel in my life, because he is the first person I have thought truly cares about me &amp; he helped me in a difficult time.

He came to my apartment and kinda never left. He had his own home but was always at my place. We ended up moving in together a couple months later. He's been the best partner I've ever had and I truly love him. We've planned our whole futures together and even talked about getting secretly eloped. We have separate bank accounts but also a joint one. We have many cars together (though one of mine is practically his since he's always driving it). We got an amazing house together last year &amp; share two cats.

He has done a great job of being a supportive boyfriend, but he doesn't sleep with me. Only sometimes. I've tried and tried to get him to increase his libido, maybe it's low testosterone? I've shut down every rumor about him being gay for years. The rejection of my request was so common and impactful that I don't even try to initiate sex anymore. I don't necessarily want to sleep with someone else, but sex with him has also gotten boring. It's always the same spot, the same moves, same position...he doesn't even kiss me much outside of sex. I have to practically force him to kiss me once a day! It's hurt my self esteem that he doesn't want to fuck me like the 20 other guys who try to text me everyday. I'm 21 and in great shape &amp; looks, I can worry about this when I'm 49--not 21! I've been dealing with this since I was 19 and it's made me think I have a significantly lower libido than I really do.

Here's the thing: I've changed a lot in the years we have been together--he hasn't. I've invested a significant amount of time, money, and energy into healing through my traumas and building the life I want to live. I'm a completely different person than who he met, which I'm sure he loves me more now. 

I've always wanted to live a more relaxed life as a stay at home mom, but am good at making money. He is not nearly as ambitious as me, so I feel like this will never be an option for me. Plus, I've built my career in business &amp; real estate. He hasn't even started to build a career. I try everything to help him accomplish his goals, but it feels like he doesn't have the drive to get things done. Not even write down what time his hockey game is on the calendar.

There are so many other factors to the relationship that I just don't have time to type. I'm practically married in this though! I feel like I've been mentally checking out of the relationship for a couple months due to lack of intimacy and quality time. He goes through phases where he will only play Xbox or a certain hobby with his friends &amp; the same with sex (a bunch at once and nothing for weeks). He's been irritating me so much lately and i haven't enjoyed kissing him recently. This is so horrible to admit, but maybe there's no going back with me checking out. I just can't muster up nearly as much attraction for him anymore.

Real estate hasn't been paying the bills for months now, so he has been paying some of my bills for me. I'm so grateful for his help and it has meant the world to me. I don't want to stay with him simply because he's helping me, it feels wrong to do. I think I'm just in a weird position and have no idea what I should do.

I've had everyone around me tell me to leave him for months. Even an old client of mine called the other day to see if I've left him yet! People say I'm much better looking than him (we all know looks aren't everything!) and I can find someone who will treat me better since I'm so young. As a pretty attractive woman, there are a lot of men who want to date me. By no means am I trying to leave the relationship to explore other options, but im wondering if it has run its course?

I feel like I'm too invested in this relationship to ever leave and I don't want to hurt him. I've left him once before because he barely spent time with me for 6+ months and he was destroyed...I don't want to do that to him again.

At the end of the day, he is such a sweet guy and I love him dearly. He's the only guy I can confidently say I'll love forever. But are we a good match? Should I leave him?

relationship_advice,"Girlfriend and I have known each other for 7 months and been official for just over 1 month now. This is her first relationship, whereas I have had a couple before. She lives in another city about an hour and a half away, where we both go to university.

Early on into dating I suggested meeting at her apartment before we went out on a date, however she very apologetically said that wasn't possible, as her housemate doesn't like people being at their apartment. The anecdote she attached was based off one time she tried to bring one of our classmates round for a short time to do some important admin, and her housemate got quite annoyed at this.

For some context, my girlfriend and her housemate are both from far away and moved here together to attend university, and are likely going to continue to live together in the coming years. They go out together often and seem to get along well.

Naturally I was a bit confused. I expressed some disappointment as it's quite important to me (definitely in the early stages of a relationship) to be able to spend quality time in private, and it doesn't feel right to constantly be staying at my place for it.

She said she'd talk to her housemate about it, which was nice hear. I even suggested the 3 of us going for lunch or similar so her housemate can get to know me before proposing the idea of me coming round.

A couple weeks have passed since then, we've been on a few dates and mentioned the situation a few times in passing but haven't properly talked about it again until tonight over dinner. She mentioned it's been hard for her to start the dialogue with her housemate as firstly her housemate ""scares"" her a bit since she can be ""quite serious"", and secondly, they apparently agreed before they moved in together to not have anyone at their apartment. (My girlfriend didn't expect to be entering a relationship)

I didn't want to be too pushy about the situation since it was edging towards a ""me over the housemate"" scenario (which felt inappropriate given we've only been together a month) so I affirmed that she only has to have the conversation with her housemate if she wants me to come round, and not only because I do.

She assured me if she was living on her own, she would absolutely want me to come round to her place, but it seems she wants to keep her housemate appeased to continue living together amicably.

Though, since our university is considerably closer to where she lives than it is for me, it would be strange to not go to her place every so often after class or if we stay out late in the city she lives in. Furthermore, whilst things may be different in a years time, the prospect of potentially never being able to visit or stay at my girlfriends apartment for a number of years (should all go well) is a bit of a shame.

I'm getting the intrusive thought this may be a deal-breaker, but I'm hoping my girlfriend attempts to address the situation, stand up to her housemate, or make up for it some-how.

Or perhaps I'll just have to get over it and accept the fact she'll have to come round to my place a lot - which feels like the less over-reactive way forward.",0,Is it valid to be upset about potentially never being able to visit or stay at my (21M) girlfriend's (25F) place because of her problematic housemate?

relationship_advice,"My partner and I live on a very small island with his parents. When I say small island, I mean it takes about an hour to drive around the island at minimum, and everyone knows each other (about 1,600 people).

Yesterday, my partner, myself and his family went for a beautiful BBQ down by the sea. We all piled onto his dads truck, with his parents in the front holding our daughter, and my partner and I sitting on the back tray with all our gears. We left for home at about 9.30pm as it was dark, my partner and I sat on the back tray of the truck while his parents and my daughter were sitting in the front. On the drive home, his dad spotted a nice sized coconut crab, which is considered to be a delicacy here. My partner jumped off the back of the truck to pick it up, while his dad jumped out from the front to grab a sack to put it in. He said something to my partner that I didn't hear, and hurriedly got  back into the truck without waiting for my partner to put the crab in the sack, or even get back on. He took off before my partner got onto the truck and while we were driving away my partner just waved to me. He didn't call out to wait, or try and stop the truck, just waved. So I thought maybe what his dad had said to him was a plan on how he would get home.

We got home, all the while I was worried about my partner. It was dark, he didn't have his phone on him, and it was about a 2 hour walk to get back. His dad asked me where he was, and confused, I told him he didn't get back on the truck. Angry, he took off in my partners mums truck just as my partner pulled up. Some family friends had seen him walking and given him a ride. I was so relieved he was home safe, but felt so stupid for not tapping on the glass or the roof of the truck to tell his dad to stop.

Now my partner won't talk to me at all, and I understand why.

relationship_advice,"In general, she says that I'm the most emotionally available partner she's ever had, which is something I've worked really hard on (both personally and in therapy). She's a therapist so is speaking both from a personal and professional perspective. However, when I get really overwhelmed with life stuff — things that would be legitimately overwhelming to most — I find that I have a really hard time maintaining that emotional availability. I genuinely try, but feel completely dead inside and am not willing to fake or lie how I'm feeling to her. We have a very open and honest relationship, and yes—we have talked about this exact thing on several occasions (I'm posting because it keeps coming up, even after it seems we've resolved the issue).

It feels internally like I have to shift into robot mode just to cope with the stress. This upsets my girlfriend, who feels like I'm shutting her out. She externally processes stress and likes to vent. I hate venting, which feels like a waste of energy when I have little to spare. I feel a strong urge to shift into this cold, calculating machine to churn through all the tasks to get some breathing room so I can be a person again. This makes her feel hurt and like I'm being avoidant (I started life with avoidant attached, and can say I'm significantly closer to secure now).

My question pertains to the autism spectrum / ADHD. I know that nobody here can provide diagnoses, but it's something I've wondered about for myself. My dad has really bad ADHD and is also on the spectrum, and completely shuts down when overwhelmed. When he discovered his spectrum diagnosis I did some kind of questionnaire thing that indicated I'm further along that spectrum than most and should get it checked out. However, I never felt the need to actually get any confirmation of that from a professional, since I don't feel that my life is negatively impacted (beyond this one issue I'm posting about). I do genuinely feel that I process the world differently than most, and a lot of people have told me I seem to have superpowers. I work in tech and have been very successful in large part due to how my mind works. But I also wonder if this could simply be related to nurture, watching how my dad totally shuts off when overwhelmed while growing up?

I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has experiences with this in partnership and how you have come to an understanding together. Like I said, we can and do communicate about this, and I feel that her desire to feel emotionally connected is completely reasonable. If I could find the switch inside my brain to provide that to her even when I'm overwhelmed, I'd flip it in a second. But I guess I'm not totally sure I'm wired that way?

relationship_advice,"I have been with my boyfriend for close to two years and he has suffered from premature ejaculation. I bring it up here and there but he always laughs it off and then if I get more serious he gets angry and defensive.

He only lasts a maximum of one minute — and if it's one-minute it's one-minute of bad sex because he has to go slow and be careful — so it doesn't feel good at all. If he does it properly so that it feels good he lasts about 15 seconds.

Today I broke down to him and cried as it's really taking a toll on me. I love him so much and I want our relationship to work but if this doesn't improve I don't see how it can work long-term.

I know this is a common issue and I am just wondering if anyone else has been through it and what you have tried to have a healthy sex life. I feel sad and hopeless. Our relationship is so great in every other way but the importance of sex cannot be discounted.

relationship_advice,"TLDR; My crush and I are *probably* both into eachother but I’m completely socially inept and freak out when I talk to her. Can’t decide how to get her number and need help from socially able people.

FYI- I have autism, ADHD, major anxiety, and major depression. That’ll probably help with context.

So this semester I’ve been taking a writing class and enjoying it pretty well. After talking to my professor about some subjects for non-fiction; we settled on my ex-abuser. I waited till almost everyone was out of class, except for the person this post is about.

Before this we’d only ever interacted once with a simple hi and a wave. 

When the day to look over our work came around my group was missing a member, and as a result we left class early. After grabbing food and heading outside she caught me and asked why I left class, and said she was looking for me. At this moment I went completely braindead and just said “oh we were missing a person”. Then asked her how class went and we were both all smiles. I did break off the conversation too fast and forgot to get her number. 

I still don’t know if she overheard what I was writing about and got worried, or if she was showing interest there. Ever since then I have noticed that she stares at me a lot in class and mirrors all my tics(stretching, touching hair, leg bouncing, etc).

When I eventually got enough courage to talk to her again I complimented her poetry, and started asking lots of questions about school. Before I knew it I had accidentally walked with her to another building, and I was like “uhm, where are we going?”

Then she asked me “I’m going to Starbucks, I think - wait are you following me?”

I immediately lost all composure feeling like I’m an utter creep, and I started to leave but she told me I could stay with her if I wanted. After that I just sorta spilled spaghetti for 20 minutes and forgot to get her number again.

We’ve only ever talked in class since then and I want to get in contact outside class, but I don’t want to embarrass myself or her in front of everyone else.

The only thoughts I have for how to proceed are to email her, hand her a note in class with my contact info and a bit of simpery, or just wait outside the building so I can talk to her while getting the least social exposure. The only issue is that every day I screw up I get more anxious about it, and it doesn’t help that we only have 7 days of class left.",0,I’m(22M) autistic and don’t know how to ask a classmate(21F) out,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8870914,1682541419,0,1682541438,1682541439,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,11,459

relationship_advice,"I've been seeing this guy now for about three months. We were friends for a little while, but it gradually transitioned into FWB. When this started, I had no intentions of catching feelings for him, but now i've fallen hard. I sleep over his place multiple times a week, we hang out without having sex often, i've met some of his family, he takes me to run errands with him, he cooks for me and drives me places even though he doesn't have to. At this point, it's no longer FWB - we're in a relationship with no label. It's gotten to the point where my friends refer to him as my boyfriend, because that's basically what he is, right? I'm really struggling with whether I should drop the dreaded ""what are we?"" question or just end this entirely without ever saying how I feel.

       In the beginning we would have sex 5 times or more a week.   It has gradually became less and less often, which can be expected, except it’s down to once a month or less.  It went down to twice a week after about 6 months, then once a week, to  a couple of times a month.   Recently it’s been 35 days, and nothing.   I have asked him what the issue is, if he’s not attracted to me, etc.   He claims he doesn’t feel in the mood.  I try making advances, and am always turned down.

relationship_advice,"I began dating my exboyfriend in January and everything was great, even before in our talking stage he was so sweet and was always able to keep a conversation going and was genuinely interested in what I liked or disliked, hobbies etc…. But it was awhile in us dating when one day he took down a video of us he put on his instagram highlights, and I was very confused but I didn’t want to start a fight and bring it up. Then it was the day before Valentine’s Day and we were talking and he tells me “you can’t even speak Spanish” for context we were both born the U.S but his dad did some shady stuff and him and his family were sent back to Mexico so he only speaks Spanish but knows some English, but I have had my education in the U.S but I do speak Spanish since my parents speak very little English, my Spanish isn’t the worst, I can definitely understand a lot more than I can speak but I’m still able to communicate efficiently. Anyways, I don’t like when people tell me that I can’t speak Spanish so I send him the middle finger emoji, but mostly for the shits and giggles and because that’s how I play around with people and I’ve told him time and time again that that is how I am, and then he asks me to apologize but I tell him no because I felt hurt that he said that. He didn’t respond after that and not even the next day. So I text the council (my friends) to get their perspective on it, and one of them told me I should apologize and to stop being stubborn, so ok maybe I was being to harsh, I’ll apologize. I text him that I’m sorry but that I also don’t like that he says that I can’t speak Spanish because it hurts my feelings. This was on Valentine’s Day and it’s not until late at night when I finally get a response from him saying “Happy Valentine’s Day even though you treat me bad”, I was baffled and beyond pissed that he went the whole day not speaking to me. But we talked it out and I apologized and he apologized. To some who are still  wondering about the video of us he took down I brought it up with him about 3 times and each time he said he would put it back up he didn’t, his excuse for taking it down was that I didn’t heart the story which I guess in his mind means I didn’t like it. Then about a week goes by and he posts on his instagram story to send him anonymous messages through this site. A day later he started to respond to them and what I saw broke my heart. There were girls asking him to text them and that they wanted to marry him or them confessing their feelings. And all he would reply to those was “who could you be?” or “who are you?” Not once mentioning that he had a girlfriend, I tried texting him and confronting him about it but he wouldn’t respond and continues to post on his insta story.

Let me start off by saying this I (18f) have a boyfriend (18m) and we have been together for almost 7 months. I know it’s not been a long time but allow me to explain. We are long distance. I don’t get the chance to see him as often as we’d like but, we make it work. Recently, he’s began to pull away from me more and more so he can work on his mental health. We had a rough patch about a month ago where we would argue over the littlest things. I thought things were getting better. We usually only call briefly at night now as he’s always too busy with work, school or friends. I have explained to him I need more communication being long distance and having difficulty of not communicating as much as usual. 

Today I told him that I needed him because I’ve just not had a great day form the morning. He then proceeded to make plans with his best friend who “needed him more”. I completely understand that he made plans but I had said way before I needed someone to talk to and he completely disregarded my feelings. Eventually, he called me for about 15 minutes while his friend was sat outside. I asked him who needed him more and he told me “my best friend”. He never cared to ask or find out what was wrong. I’m not saying I needed him more but when your partner is slowly pushing you away and not calling you over a period of 3 weeks i feel like that would effect the average person. He said he was sorry but sorry I feel can’t just fix that.

relationship_advice,"Hi everyone so my gf of 5 months sort of ghosted me for a few days this week and I'm not sure how to approach it with her because her reasons dont make sense to me. 

She lives in the apartment complex across from mine so we've been having dinner with each other almost every night, and often have breakfast together too. Out of the past 2 weeks before she did this we had dinner together every single day except two to give you an idea. 

We had dinner plans for Sunday night but I canceled for personal reasons, and we texted through the night like normal. Next morning I hit her up for breakfast and she said she has her handsfull for today and probably wont have time to see me but offered to get me breakfast delivered to my job. I thought that was super weird since she said all day and not just breakfast. I asked if she had some big plans for the day or something and she said she just has a lot going on and she needs to organize some things. 

I didn't reply to her after that around 6pm, obviously I didnt go to sleep, and she didnt bother texting me again. It wasnt until 4-5pm yesterday did I text her back and asked if there was something she needed to tell me. She told me no and asked why and called me but didnt facetime me which is what she usually does. She asked what was wrong and why I didnt reply and I asked her what she had planned for the day and she said the same stuff as yesterday and that she should be free by Wednesday. We talked a little more but went to bed. I asked her again this morning about it. 

She says she just had an ""adhd moment"" and started cleaning her apartment a lot and things were a mess while also doing her hair, and she said her hair takes her 1-2 full days to finish and that it doesn't count as ghosting because she texted back and picked up calls, even though she would not answer face time calls without a hoodie or face mask thing on.

relationship_advice,"This is a burner because I've never really used reddit and there could be negative consequences if anyone in my life saw this and recognized the situation.

My boyfriend (21 M) and I (19 F) have been together for 15 months or so and love one another more than anything and do a very good job at maintaining a healthy and mutually happy relationship. Our one sticking point is the strange way God seems to have put us together for some divinely difficult reason - he has a weight gain fetish and I am recovered from an eating disorder. Originally, we both had wanted to wait for marriage to have sex for spiritual reasons but about a year into our relationship after we'd both searched the Bible and considered the character of God for years, we decided it would be okay and a good addition to our relationship to start a physical part of our relationship gently and with love as the focus. Several weeks after we started sleeping together my boyfriend reveals to me he has a weight gain fetish and asks me to participate in it by talking about myself gaining weight. I'd already known he was into bigger girls than me - which broke my heart and continues to because I feel like I can never satisfy him - but this was like a kick to the stomach. Months ago he started talking about how good I would look with bigger boobs or 30 lbs heavier and it scared me. He showed me a picture of his ideal, after me bugging him to one night when I let the unhealthy part of my brain win. IIRC he was careful not to pressure me and brought it up after me asking what I could do to make our sex life better for him, and told me he didn't want me to do it if I didn't want to, but if I was talking to a friend in my situation I'd tell her he should've protected her from this knowledge. Participating in his fetish is only slightly painful in the moment but after we're done it leaves me feeling unloved and like I've betrayed myself. Like I'm a placeholder for a girl he'd rather have and I'm helping him fantasize about her. Or my head on her body. It makes me feel like sex is now lust and fetish and not love. He also doesn't make me feel beautiful anymore like he used to. The biggest thing is I absolutely will not and can not EVER gain weight for his sexual gratification. How do I continue in this relationship knowing I can never satisfy this desire in him and he is always thinking about a bigger body, and can't make me feel as beautiful as somebody else might? I really don't want to be selfish here and focus on my perception of myself at all but for my health I can't do it. I don't know what to do. We both don't want breaking up to be an option and at the moment I'm trying to practice radical acceptance and want to wait for marriage again. I asked him if he's okay with waiting again and he said sure, if he can. I haven't really explained any of this to people I know because I am alone in my circle concerning my sexual ethics and I don't want to change others' understanding of me, my boyfriend, our relationship, etc. What can I do? Thank you for reading if you see this or got this far.

relationship_advice,"Hi, so for a little background: my bf and I have been in a strong and happy relationship for almost 3 years now. A few months ago I left the country for a gap year and we are in a long distance relationship for this year. The original plan was to figure out what I want to do in life and then come back to my country to move in with him and study/work. He supported my decision to do the gap year and so far the long distance relationship is working pretty well and he would be coming to visit me sometime soon.

The problem now is that I want to travel more and I am also interested in studying something, that is not possible to study in my home country. I want to live in different countries, study there and I don't want to live in my home country anymore. I want to return to catch up with my family and friends and get everything done to move abroad, but I don't want to stay longer than a year.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, is starting college in September and will be working his dream job after that and wants to stay in our home country. He only wants to travel a few times a year and wants me to stay with him in our home country.
He also wants to have kids and I don't and he says that's fine, but I'm not sure he would be happy if he had to give that up for me.

We are struggling to find a compromise and pretty much know we don't have a future together. That being said, our relationship is perfect right now so it hurts a lot to end things.
We don't really know what to do. Should we break up now or wait 1-2 years until I move abroad (which will probably hurt even more)? Should either of us give up our careers/life dreams so we can stay together? I would appreciate any advice you have.

Hi, long time lurker first time poster. Im (28m) exhausted and looking for advice here. I dont know what to do with my relationship with my gf (28f) anymore. Context: been together for 7 years now, been through some rough patches for both of us, briefly took a break to take some space from each other but we came back together. She has been great, the most loyal and kind person i ever met and the reason i fell in love with her in the first place. She is a compassionate and caring person and always thought about others instead of her. But her family has been very abusive and manipulative ever since ive known them. Im not sure if she was in denial or thought that was normal but not being able to cook or clean after certain hours and getting into arguements over the most miniscule things every day. While she has a specialised degree she still works in retail and has adopted 4 cats whilst living with them which i suggested would be a bad idea financially to take care of them and save for our financial goals as well as having them around her family i wouldnt put it past them to do something. She has no concept of finances and impulsively buys everything for her cats and expects me to pay for them which i do reluctantly because i feel guilted into doing so even though i knew it was a bad financial decision. We used to be intimate and nice with each other but her ocd makes her angry at me when i try to give her affection. My love language is physical touch and hers is not. She gets angry and pushes me away when i try hold her hand the wrong way or even hug her too long. Recently one of her cats got sick and past away and she quit her job to take care of it whilst i paid for all the bills. I dont mind helping but she kind of expected me to do this without any care about we would make it work i felt guilted into saying yes. Now its been 2 months and she has hasnt worked still. She says shes returning but we will see. I feel trapped that i cant leave because she relys on me and that shes one step away from being homeless as her parents (we both still live at home) want her gone and she has no family and minimal friends. She wants to live the traditional roles lifestyle (men work, woman housewife) but she doesnt want to have kids for like 5 years and just wants to adopt cats and birds. She also doesnt know how to do basic tasks around the house (i do the cooking, cleaning, etc) I honestly dont know what to do anymore, kinda hope a truck takes me out on the way home everyday so i dont have to deal with it.

relationship_advice,"Me and my boyfriend whos been together for two months had a huge argument this week and decided to cool off for a bit. We almost broke up at that moment but decided to cool off instead. We’ve argued about our differences and how it’s affecting our relationship, we’ve only been officially together for two months. This arguments was mainy an emotional build-up of frustrations as we felt that our emotional needs weren’t being met as of the moment due to our schedule, health problem, etc. We plan on talking about it over the weekend when we decided to take a short break. 

He still cares, and was even about to come with me for my check-up even though we were having an argument. I thought it was okay already when he told me by our callsign and said that he loves me. He’s currently checking up on me as im dealing with a potential serious health problem as well, and made plans to have a date next week like we’ve talked about but before he went to bed, he said we need to talk about us in person, and that he’s leaning more on breaking up.

relationship_advice,"Trying to TLDR it as much as I can, but happy to provide more context in comments. 

Met a girl this past weekend. She has slept with one of my best friends before (which I am 100% okay with) and they are great friends still. 

She came onto me the other day, wanting to stick with me vs. the group she is normally with/that guy. We hung out that night and had an unreal time/got to know each other.

She is a very straightforward/honest girl - and I mean she made comments saying she wants me/to sleep with me. I wouldn’t do anything until I had a 1:1 with that best friend, because last thing I want to do is have him upset. He basically told me that because she told him she likes her freedom and doesn’t want to be exclusive with him/other guys she is talking to and he gives his blessing for whatever happens next. 

During the end of the day, we’ve been drinking/dancing whatever and she continues teasing me with comments that 100% turned me on. It gets towards the end of the night and she is starting to crash, so that put an end to anything happening bc no way in hell I’m pushing boundaries (almost feels like I was too nice of a guy and she wanted me to). Dropped her off and said bye. She drunk texts me after saying I shouldn’t have left, but I knew we were still hanging out that next day. 

Next day comes and it’s JUST us 2 the entire day. A lot of dancing, but this time more….physical let’s say. During this next day, all of the grinding/hand holding/head resting, following with her calling me handsome/charming/sexy/touching up on me. I legit lost count of how many times she said she wanted to sleep with me, but it almost sounded as if she was told not to sleep with me/something in her head is stopping her from doing it. 

End of the night comes and she can’t walk anymore and wants to lay down/has no energy, but is having so much fun she doesn’t want to end. I walked her out, got us some food to sober up and made sure she was good before dropping her off. 

It almost seems like a guy has never treated her that way and she was crushing on me, but is conflicted about giving up her freedom/there is something else in the equation I don’t know about. 

My head is so lost because I don’t want to crush on her if she doesn’t want a relationship, but I wouldn’t mind a fwb situation/learn if I did something wrong/how I can improve with girls in general. I’ve never been blue balled so hard before.

relationship_advice,"Hi, Im (F19) at a difficult cross roads right now and this is not an easy story to tell, and right now, I think strangers on the internet will be more beneficial to me than my friends or family with this situation. 

To start off, I’ve been in a relationship for a little over 7 months with M18 (this is accounting for a 2 month break up we had). I am a very insecure person, something my bf had known prior to getting into a relationship with me both times. I am very needy, irrational, and argumentative. I have taken steps to alleviate these issues as they not only cause problems in my relationship, but it’s extremely draining for myself. Our relationship is very unhealthy and toxic &amp; I am trying so hard to make it healthy. 

The beginning was great as all relationships are, he went above and beyond setting standards that he simply could not maintain later in our relationship. He went out of his way to reassure me, validate me, and make sure I felt loved. In my past relationship I was cheated on, amounting to some serious trust issues which he accommodated for and made sure I knew he was someone I could trust. 

Then the arguing started. I cant pinpoint when, but all of a sudden me expressing my discomfort with certain things (in a way to NOT start an argument) ended up with him telling me that I am being ridiculous and starting an argument or a full blown ‘petty’ war. I have always been the one to apologize and beg for him to stop being mad, pushing aside my feelings and telling him that I don’t feel that way anymore even if I do just so he will stop ignoring me. I would say during our entire relationship he has never said sorry or took accountability for instigating some of these fights. 

Anyways, this led to us breaking up the first time, then I begged for him back (stupid) and we got back together. A week later he broke up with me again, we were so distant and things were just crumbling apart. This time I didnt beg for him back, instead I tried to move on because I realized our relationship wasn’t good. About a monthish later he reached out to me, saying the typical things like “i miss you” etc.. I knew during this time that he was only reaching out because it didn’t work out with the girl he tried to move on with, yet, I got suckered in thinking something would change. We would talk off and on, and finally when I confronted him and told him to tell me his true intentions behind reaching out (I was trying to gauge if he wanted to get back together) he said “you’re like a drug i cant get enough of you, im addicted” then in the same sentence said he didn’t want to get back together but he was still in love with me. Im naive, but not that naive, so I cut the contact right there because I wasn’t going to let him get my hopes up. A week later hes back in my life telling me he doesn’t want to get back together, but at the same time he does. Long story short, we are back together (there’s that naiveness). 

The only reason why I got back with him was because I was fooled into thinking he changed. He did, but in a horrible way. It was great the first two weeks, no arguments, then that’s when it all goes downhill. He openly disrespects me and insults me, his excuse his “it’s because you’re my girlfriend”. He looks at girls online and will talk about how hot they are, knowing how insecure I get. Attractive people don’t stop existing once you’re in a relationship, I get that, but I HAVE NEVER done that to him because in my mind it is disrespectful. I voice this insecurity with him and I kid you not, he mocks me. I tell him that I don’t care if he finds other girls attractive, I would just prefer it if he doesn’t voice it in front of me. He keeps doing it, almost as if he’s trying to get a rise out of me. 

He has literally told me that he does stuff on purpose to make me mad because he thinks it’s “cute”. He even FORCES me to apologize when I do get mad. 

Yesterday we had a huge fight because a boundary of mine had been seriously crossed. I cried in front of him. He laughed at me. In that moment I lost all of my respect for him. It made me realize how much of a joke I am to him. I had threatened to break up with him because of him not taking my concerns seriously, but then 5 minutes later I took it back because for some reason some sick part of me thinks this treatment is normal and that I was just being as ridiculous as he was saying. 

He has also started lying so much about very small things.. it’s one of my biggest pet peeves and he knows this, yet laughs at me when I catch him in a lie. He’s now mad because I said I don’t trust him anymore. His reason for lying is because “these things don’t even matter so why do you care”. The said lie in question was that he told me this girl followed him on instagram, only for me to later find out, he GAVE his instagram to her. He then said “well I told her I have a girlfriend,” again, only for me to find out he never did. 

I enjoy our good times so much and I feel like that’s what makes me hesitate to leave, but I am SICK of being pushed into tears then him falling asleep right after with no care. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore, I can’t break this unhealthy attachment I have to him and bring myself to break up with him but I know I need to. Please any advice would be much appreciated.

relationship_advice,"Before we started dating, my girlfriend was a friend-of-a-friend who I didn't really know in real life. I followed her on social media and really liked her personality based on her posts. She occasionally posted about how she never found anyone good on dating apps. I've always thought it's really transparent and kinda aggressive to ""slide into someone's DMs,"" so I was more comfortable with the idea of meeting on a dating app. She lives in my city, so all I had to do was download several popular apps and swipe through until I found her. Lo and behold we matched and I played it off as a  coincidence that we had mutual friends. 

Fast forward to now and I feel a little weird that she doesn't know how our relationship *really* started. Was it wrong to do this in the first place? Should I tell her? I don't know how she would  react. 

I actually had a guy confess to doing the exact same thing to me a few years ago and I was a little unsure how I felt about it at the time. I had just gotten out of a relationship but I decided to get on dating apps right away. I matched with a guy I didn't know very well from my college program and we started dating. A little while into the relationship and he confessed that he only downloaded the dating app because he heard I was single and swiped left on every person until he found me. 

That wasn't why the relationship ultimately didn't work out. In my opinion he's a normal well-adjusted guy, he just wasn't the right person for me. I thought it was odd but it didn't make me feel uncomfortable because I already knew him well enough when he told me that I trusted he didn't have any bad intentions doing it. I also didn't think it would be an issue even if he never told me. I figured it doesn't matter *how* he matched with me because I swiped right on him of my own volition. 

Since I was okay with it when it happened to me I didn't really think twice before I did it to someone else, but I'm worried that if my girlfriend knew the truth she might feel differently.",0,Should I (25f) tell my girlfriend (28f) that I only met her on a dating app because I already knew I could find her there?,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8870767,1682540055,0,1682540073,1682540073,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,25,385

I also have other interviews coming up, so I will be waiting for other opportunities as they come. 

However, my views on the relationship has changed. My boyfriend changed his mind and asserted that he wanted to try LDR...Only after I told him that I turned it down. When we were discussing about this, he didn't want to do a LDR (even though it already is), or even consider living with me just for one year after his graduation. This has made me realize that we are on a different page about our future. 

I have tried my best to compromise, but it seems that I have been sacrificing myself for someone who doesn't know what he wants. I have apologized to him that given our differences in career field/age/phase in life, I feel I have pressured him into making decisions about our relationship too early, and that he should enjoy his youth. It was a long conversation, and sadly, I don't think much has changed. From now on, I will be making future plans only for myself...which should've been prioritized from the beginning. 

Thank you everyone for your comments, it has made me realize a lot about the dynamic of our relationship.

This is someone who treats me like I’m the love of his life one day and like I’m evil for having needs the next. I openly communicate to him when I feel like he’s done something hurtful or has not been meeting my needs. The only “needs” I have are ones for communication, I have bad anxiety, so I try and let him know that if he’s not going to see me for a few weeks to please call me. Whenever I try and communicate to him that he’s done something hurtful he gets defensive. The times he does see me irl he never spends the night and then I’ll see him again in a few weeks. He treats me like I’m trying to guilt trip him whenever I express I’m feeling hurt, and him feeling that way is what leads to his non-commitment. I am not trying to guilt trip him whenever I share that I’m hurt, I’m trying to communicate I’m hurt so we can come to a solution, but he doesn’t see it that way. I try my hardest to communicate as effectively as possible and let him know my reasoning.

We've been together less than a year, so it's even more worrying me. So we started dating quite quickly, it took 1-2 months and we were inseparable. We were going out a lot, wishing to explore more sexually and trying new activities. I loved partying with him and we had great honeymoon phase but after 6-7months living with him and working less because job didn't give enough hours, I stopped going out or be invited because he'll not pay for me all the time, of course, i don't want to be a weight. Knowing I was in the a bad place mentally wasn't the best too, changed meds, got seasonal depression.

One of the issues is that I'm not comfortable is him partying with his female coworker and getting blackout drunk like yesterday or legit doing activities together and her best friend. I understand not being invited to his work related stuff but he often goes out saying that he's stressed at work and this is a way to cope. He said at the beginning of our relationship that he doesn't believe in friendships between f and m but after him going out often with her and coworkers or alone with her and sharing about the fact that I got pregnant (personal info), I once again talked to him and he said that yeah, it's becoming a friendship and that he'll give it a chance. That he has 0 interest in her, that he understands my jealousy because he'd be like this too if the roles were inversed.

Anyway, I can get past the friendship because I do believe that they can be friends but not while drinking and occasionally doing coke ( but not anymore) with her and other coworker 2 to 4 times a week. (They're usually 3 but the guy friend lately is not going out that frequently because his fiancee is against it and also because alcohol is expensive lol).

I talked with him about it, he says he understands, tries to stay at home but they day after, he ends up texting me that he's really drunk and regrets going out and spending money again. For the pregnancy, we both agreed it's abortion, I'm totally fine with the decision. But the day after intervention, he went out.

He says that he goes out and drinks because it's the only activity he does with his friends and with me, he likes to do different stuff. But he went lately with the f coworker and her best friend to bowling and drink and another day, they went to a work related thing but ended up pass out drunk after drinking during work with her, playing mini golf etc, to pass time. It was the day before he needed to go to a trip for few days so I was hoping to pass some time together. Didn't happen obv.

I'm having crying sessions everyday, probably because of abortion hormones and maybe meds but also the situation. I can't face the fact that he's not receptive or doesn't seem to see the problem? 

I asked him today if it would be ok to ask him to go out less and that i'd like to go out to drink too, as before, with his or my friends when it's not 100% work. He seemed to agree but after saying he'll try to go out less with his friends, like once a week and more with me (for me) and that he tries a lot to make me feel good. And it's true, when present, he's affectionate and writes me cute messages and do love me. But i know he's not liking the routine that our relationship became but I don't see him proposing stuff? Same thing in sex life. I got my libido finally back but we don't have sex as much. Now he's gone to the work trip with 3 coworkers and her.

I want to party too together, I want fun stuff too, but I can't bring it alone. 
 
For his side, I know I've been dependent financially for ~2months but not anymore. Also, I guess I'm kind of lost on what doing next but it's because all the decisions like work and school depend on this relationship. I don't feel secure in this appartment and I can't make it home until I do. So maybe it's the fact that I don't do much right now which gives me time to obsess over this. I knew he liked to drink and I liked it, I just feel out of his party life now. I feel like a wifey home waiting for husband to finish his drinking.

He's also not mentally the best, his drinking is a way to cope with the stress of the business he invested in and works at and the boss whose very questionable lol. He does talk to me about it, says I help him and support him and that it's a big help for him.


Even now, he says he wants to hug me and loves me and can't wait to see me. But I don't feel listened to when I told him I'm having a really bad mental state. Idk. I want to have opinions before fcking it up.

I'm 26 and I had long term relationships before but never have I loved someone that much and stressed that much. I just feel like I don't reach connection anymore? 

I'm just so tired and I don't know how much talking I can do. I need some perspective on this.

We didn't meet right away because we were both really busy and travelling, but we spoke on the phone for hours and texted each other constantly. He was also going through some serious mental health issues that I became an emotional support for him. He was pretty flirty and forward, it honestly felt like we were in a relationship. He would even make comments that I was his online girlfriend because we hadn't met yet. Anyways, we met a month later and it was great. It wasn't awkward and he said that it felt like he's known me for years. 

It went downhill at the end of the date though where he came on to me and wouldn't take no for an answer. It left me feeling so demeaning because even though we had such a great connection, and all these great in depth conversations, he still just wanted sex. He apologized the next day for coming on to me so hard and ""he didn't know what was wrong with him."". I mistakenly let it slide because I felt bad for all the things he was going through. 

After that situation, things shifted, he got distant and I called him out on it on the phone one night and he said that there was nothing bad he could say about the date but he felt like I had played him because I was flirty with him but turned him down. (Important to note that I had told him from the start that random hook ups, or hooks ups on first dates are not my thing). 

Anyways, it's been a year now and we only met in person that one time. However, we've spent hours on the phone discussing his mental health issues. Whenever I bring up the conversation of ""what are we? when are we meeting up again?"" he brings up his mental health and all the issues that he's dealing with. I feel like I'm just being used as a surrogate therapist and he's being so aloof of my feelings and what I need. I've been so upfront about what I need and where I stand, and the script always gets flipped on me somehow. I guess it's now coming down to realizing that I've invested so much time into someone who couldn't care less about me. I tried to brush it off like he just didn't have capacity and he was in a space where he needed someone and that just happened to be me, and if I give him time he'll come around. He would keep thanking me for being patient with him and now I think it was all just an act.

relationship_advice,"TLTR: gf left to deal with past trauma and blew up when i wanted to support her and not give up on the relationship.


For users that want context:

So my (sortof)gf and I have known each other for about 14 years. We grew up together because i was friends with her cousin(23M).

So basically what happened was I picked her up from her house on Saturday and while in the car she started talking about she can't be in a relationship because of past experiences and traumas she has to deal with. 

She basically told me:
•That her ex abused her, and after that, she wrote off relationships completely with men(yes, she is bisexual). 
•She has issues with her biological father that, on a constant basis, tells her he didn't want her and berates her.
•Some self-esteem issues and trust issues.

I told her that I would walk the road to healing with her, but she wanted to do it on her own. But she would not let me. I asked her if she was ending what we had, and she said yes. But we still had plans, and she was not in the mood for her house and step-dad, who is a complete AH that also just treats her like sh#t. 

But we went out Saturday night with friends and everything seemed fine, she kissed me, sat on my lap, we danced, made jokes like everything was back to normal. She even slept over at my house that night. 

Sunday morning came, we were cuddling and kissing just the normal good morning. Then we spoke about it again. She said she just wants to work through it but doesn't know how long it will take and that i should move on. I told her im not going anywhere and that I love her too much to deal with this on her own. But she was persistent in her decision. 

Im a guy who doesn't show a lot of emotion because of some past issues. But on that day, I cried while she held me and said everything would be okay. 

I told her that if she later on realizes she made a mistake or starts regretting her decision on leaving, she should tell me and not keep it from me. I know she still loves me, and I love her too. I dropped her off at home Sunday afternoon. Kissed her goodbye and left. 

From there on, things became worse. She started ignoring my texts, leaving me on read, being short in her answers to me, and just irritated with the fact that I'm asking if she is okay. 

I went no contact for 2 days and asked her today why she is acting like this and pushing me away or trying to fall out of love. She just blew up and admitted she is ignoring me and went on a rant on how she doesn't want to be in a relationship, but in that same week she wanted to make it official. 

The thing that hurts me the most is how she can just make up her mind and throw away what we had in a span of a few days. 

I also know she is scared of committing to a relationship now because she is studying.

My partner (23nb) and I (24nb) have lived together for about a year now. Its my responsibility to do all the chores around the house/go grocery shopping. This morning I was making myself breakfast and made the comment of ""we have no milk. Going out somewhere to get coffee seems like a lot of effort."" In response to this my partner said something along the lines of ""or you could go grocery shopping, since youre not doing anything else."" I felt like it was kind of sassy w/o reason but tried to ignore it. That didnt exactly work because we started arguing about me voicing displeasure for certain tasks (i am autistic, touching dirty dishes and going grocery shopping on my own can be very difficult tasks depending on the day). My partner interpreted me saying that going somewhere for coffee seemed like a lot of effort as me complaining about going grocery shopping, something i wasnt actively trying to do. (Grocery shopping is something I specifically asked to do together for my own comfort and my partner only does do reluctantly. Dishes were originally my partners singular chore bc of my adversion, but they weren't keeping up with them so it became my task) They then told me that me voicing displeasure over doing dishes/grocery shopping was childish, but also refused to accept my offer of me just not voicing displeasure over these things. They think that me not voicing displeasure is me pushing my feelings aside for others, but it seems like thats what they want me to do. How do i feel okay with voicing my displeasure for certain activities while also respecting my partner's wish for me to stop? If that's what's supposed to happen? Im honestly just really confused.

We've been together for a little over a year and a half. But I've lost a lot of my attraction towards him after an argument we had a month ago. 

I'd rather not say what the argument was about. But it was pretty bad.

So when I have the urge, I'd rather relieve it myself than with my partner. He's been upset by it recently. We used to do things together but not anymore. I just haven't been interested in him since our last argument a month ago. 

When I go into a separate room to do it in, he would walk in (when I don't want him too) and try to ask me why I'm in there. 

Recently, he did that again, and this time got on top of me, and started kissing all over me. I wasn't having any of it and told him to get off of me. I told him I would rather be by myself in like 5 different ways before he took it as a joke, called me a faker, and left. The thing is, I wasn't joking. 

I read up online and asked numerous people if I should be obligated to have sex with a partner? There were ultimately mixed opinions. Some said yes (especially if married), while others said no because people have a right to consent. I can see both sides. What's the point in being in a relationship if there Is no sex? On the contrary, sex shouldn't be demanded. 

I'm wondering what I should do because I don't want to lose this guy all together. Taking away the age gap, there are still qualities that I like about him. But I want my space too. He's just not respecting it.

5 month relationship that is starting to feel like such a drag.",0,My (30m) gf (26f) is very insecure and jealous over just about anything…,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8870628,1682538651,0,1682538668,1682538669,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,13,160
relationship_advice," TL;DR: five weeks ago I expressed I felt some disconnect between us, he didn't see it that day but has since been having intrusive thoughts about maybe not loving me as much or wanting to break up. We take a break and he says he loves me and that his intrusive thoughts are gone. We go back to normal for a week. His thoughts come back, he says he's going to go to therapy to sort things out and we take another break. A week has passed and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

This all started five weeks ago, when I initiated a conversation in which I expressed I had felt him slightly more distanced and disconnected for the past month or so (very subtle and I couldn't give very concrete examples, it's the kind of thing you just feel because you know the other person **that** well), as well as acknowledging I had felt more irritated by him lately due to seeing parallelisms between our relationship and my past relationship. It caught him by surprise and he couldn't see what I was talking about in the moment, but we talked it out and apparently everything was good. I felt relieved.

Since then, he had been having intrusive thoughts that he couldn't set aside about him maybe not loving me as much as before or maybe even wanting to break up. For the next two weeks we talked extensively about his thoughts, what their causes could be and the possibility that they could be mediated by his anxious and obsessive tendencies (while acknowledging they popped up for a reason) but not reaching any conclusion.

I think that was somewhat of a mistake on my part. I think it was positive that we talked about his feelings, but we talked about it for long times during those two weeks and I was talking to him as a therapist instead of a boyfriend, as if I was dettached from the situation and was seeing it from a very intellectualized perspective. I felt uncomfortable acting as a caregiver (by talking about the topic to lenghts I don't feel were right) with someone who could potentially be breaking up with me, so I asked him to take a break (with no deadline) to let him sort his feelings out. At the same time, I couldn't continue being in contact with him acting as if everything was ok if he was having those kind of thoughts about the relationship.

Two days later, he texts me that the very same day that we agreed to taking a break saying that instead of trying to fight those thoughts, he let them in and considered what they were trying to tell him. He then realized that he loved me and that despite not knowing the origin of those thoughts he thought it was only his mind trying to play games with him. It all sounded very weird to me and I think it was more his fear of breaking up talking than him having sorted out his feelings, so I asked him to stay no-contact until Monday (five days later).

We met that same monday and he said nothing had changed, repeating that he loved me and that his thoughts probably had no basis. He said he wanted to continue to be with me and that he saw us together forever. We talked extensively about our relationship, what we wanted and needed from each other and I expressed my skepticism. I chose to believe him in the moment while still keeping a look out to see if things really were how he was saying.

We reconciled and for that week it was as if we were back to where we left it before all this began to happen. He stayed at my place for the weekend and on Sunday he left in a very good note.

Monday and Tuesday we texted as usual and I felt a slight disconnect which I didn't give much thought as maybe I was being hypervigilant, but Wednesday (last week) he texts me saying he's not feeling well, that the thoughts are back and that he's going to seek help seeing a therapist. We have a call and he's sobbing. We talk briefly about his feelings and he expresses his frustration because he doesn't feel like I've changed and he doesn't harbour resentment for anything in particular about me or about the relationship.

I tell him I think it's best if we give ourselves another break and to contact me again when he has sorted out his feelings. I also told him that while I acknowledge his feelings and that it's not his fault to be confused, the situation of taking a break but then apparently sort things out to then take another break is confusing me a lot too and that I feel somewhat resentful for it.

A week has passed since went no contact and I honestly don't know what to think or do about the situation. My plan is to give him another week and do a check up if he hasn't contacted me then and set a date for two weeks after if, again, he hasn't contacted me by then.

On one hand I feel like it's only natural for someone to have doubts about a relationship and wanting to take a break to sort things out and I am willing to give him some time and space if he needs it.

On the other hand in part I feel like I shouldn't continue waiting for another person if he's not clear about what he wants from me and the relationship, especially if his thoughts are as clear as maybe now wanting to be with me.

relationship_advice,"My girlfriend and I are coming up on 5 months together, and things are going really, really great overall. 

Back in February, we were making plans one day and she mentioned she was going to get some drinks with a couple friends after work, then she'd head to my place. Afterwards, she goes on to mention that one of the two friends she was getting drinks with was a guy she slept with a few times last year. They've only ever been friends, never dated, just something that happenned while they were both drunk and single. 

Obviously I appreciated that she told me and I know that means I can trust her, but I can't lie and say it doesn't make me a bit uncomfortable. I want to make it clear that I have not, and would not ask her to stop being friends with someone (and she  herself has said that she won't do that). But I've not been in a position before where my partner is friends with someone they've had casual sex with, so I'm having a hard time with these thoughts/emotions. They have only hung out the one time since we've started dating, not sure how regular of an occurrence it'll be. But they also participate in extra curricular activities together, so it's something I need to address internally so that I don't let it effect me.

It's not so much that I think anything would happen. She told me she made it clear to this guy that she's in a happy relationship, and I trust her. 

It's just that when I think of the two of them hanging out together, knowing the history they have, I feel uneasy. It's difficult to describe. But because I love her, and legitimately want/see a future with her, I want to deal with it.

She openly told me she slept around a bit when she was single, and I was in a relationship for 8.5 years prior to dating her and never had that kind of experience - so maybe that's contributing to these feelings.

relationship_advice,"I (30M) started dating R (30F) about 2 months ago. We had been friends for a couple years through work, but one night we were partying together, I made a move and took her home. I had just gotten out of a 3 year LTR and told her that I didn't want anything serious, but I quickly found myself developing feelings and we went from FWB to exclusive casual to serious relationship over the span of 2 months. I should have seen that coming - I'm a softie and not into casual sex, and she's been implying the whole time that she wanted more from me as well.

I really like her, but I've learned some details about her past that have sent me into a spiral lately. I have always been relationship-oriented, but I'm not a prude. I lost my virginity at 15 and so did she. But in the time since then, I've only had LTRs and a couple flings - totaling 8 women. On the other hand, she has only ever had one night stands and FWB situations. I don't know her number, and I don't think it would help if I did, but I do know that she told me that at a few points ""it was a different guy every weekend"". To add to this, 6 months before we got together, she went to Vegas and hooked up with a guy who she knew had a wife and kid. I don't even love the concept of marriage and I never want kids, but that one has been bugging me a lot.

I've never been the jealous type in any of my relationships. I encourage flirting with other guys, cause I like when other guys want what I have. But this information unlocked thoughts that I've never had before. If she is used to hooking up with strangers at bars and when she travels, it makes it much harder to trust her. If she's okay with being the girl that married men cheat with, is she okay with cheating in our relationship? The fact that I fear her number is also a new feeling. I have no idea what it is, but I really fear that it's over 40 or 50. I feel like shit because I like her and don't want to slut-shame, but that is a really high number compared to mine.

I'm not worried about whether I'm ""the best she's had"". I mostly learned about her past through her telling me about how much better I am than everyone else. I know she's had a crush on me since we met, it's not like she settled for me. Part of me is flattered that she has so many options but still chooses me. Maybe she also got it out of her system and knows what she wants now. I guess it just turns me off that whenever we run into a male friend of hers, the thought of ""has he been inside her"" inevitably crosses my mind.

I cant think clearly enough to see if her past attitudes toward sex are a red flag or not. I want to make things work, but I know these feelings will fester if I don't do anything about them. I have the urge to look through her phone to see who she's been with. I have the urge to ask her how many men she's been with and why she chose that lifestyle over having stable partners. But I know that those are horrible roads to go down with only negative outcomes. How do I address this without it making it worse for myself or destroying the relationship?

relationship_advice,"So my bf and I have been together for 2 years and we actually met on Xbox playing video games. Games have been the thing we always share as a hobby and do together. But since he’s been very young he’s been playing a game called EverQuest. It’s a very old mmo and he plays the old version of it called p99.  I’ve tried playing with him multiple times and i got into it a bit but it’s not my cup of tea. It’s very time consuming and time dependent. Some mobs/loot are on timers so he often jumps at the chance to go kill something in order to get its rare loot. If it’s not an alert then he is camping a mob, or just sitting trying to buy things, or just lvling..etc. Long story short, there is always something to do in that game and almost always, one single takes much longer than expected. I’ve never had a problem with the fact that he plays this game, I love that he enjoys it and it makes him happy but I’ve asked him multiple times to tone it down and to not prioritize it over real life. We both work from home which is amazing but that also means he’s on that game constantly. He turns it on from the moment he gets up and it doesn’t get off until bed or sometimes leaves it open throughout the night. He spends the entire day on the game and even as he is working, on phone calls, his hands are killing something in the game on the side. I don’t love it but if he gets his stuff done then who am I to judge. Its when work is over and it’s our time to hangout, go to the gym, do dinner, and just spend quality time together that the problem comes in. He is on the game so much for so long than our time keeps getting pushed aside. Sometimes when we’re talking about something important he will put me on hold for the game. When we finally do hangout, like playing a game together, he has that game on the side and constantly gets distracted. I’ve asked him multiple times if during our times, he can be present bc that game can wait. He keeps saying I’m right that he knows he over does it and that he will work on it but the next day it’s the same thing. This has been a problem for as long as I can remember. Last night we had a fight about it bc I said I feel like I’m not seeing changes. He insists that it’s different bc this time he was open with me with the fact that he’s gonna do it. I said I appreciate the communication but the problem is he keeps prioritizing it over real life. He said he’s trying to balance real life but making sure he does what he wants too. I said he always does what he wants(aka the game). Since he is already on it all day I don’t see why he can’t tone it down for some quality time. I don’t feel like I’m asking for a lot. Last night I asked for a couple of hours after he’s been on all day. This morning he said he knows he shouldn’t have he just needed “this one thing” but he says that literally every time. There’s always gonna be something new to get. I’m not sure what to do at this point I’m getting worned down. I don’t know if he doesn’t know how serious it is or if he just doesn’t care. I’m starting to get depressed and avoidant. I want him to be happy and do what he wants but also consider me in some of those decisions. I feel pushed away and neglected and he knows that. He says he’s making changes but it’s been months and there are minimal changes. Idk what to do anymore. Is this normal? Is this obsession?

Neither of us had a very active sex life before getting together. No kids and both of us work full time jobs( usually with 1 day off together.)

Fastfoward some more, and now in the last 2.5 years I can count on 1 hand the number of times we have had marital relations. I love my wife and don't have anything else to complain about except this one issue. I've tried talking to her numerous about it and how it's starting to make me feel in the relationship. Sometimes I feel like I'm just there so she doesn't have to be alone or that I'm just her roommate. She has issues with body image positivity and I've tried to get her to seek counseling for it. She also has an excuse everytime I bring it up on why she doesn't want to. Ex. Tired, too sore, too early, too late, ect... I thought at one point she might be asexual but she denies that.

relationship_advice,"
We have been together for 9 years, married for almost 6. When we got together things were magical, we were best friends, sex was frequent and spicy, and life was simply amazing. Much of our fun was based around alcohol, and while she grew out of that phase over the years I became a severe alcoholic. She made it clear that it was affecting her view of our relationship, making it feel one sided (I’ve always been employed and present for our kids, but that presence was obviously limited and inconsistent due to alcohol abuse) and that I seemed more like a liability/responsibility to her than a partner. She lost all sexual interest in me. I dabbled in sobriety for a while, and now am 6 months sober with a fresh outlook on life and full of motivation to be the best me possible for myself and my family. But I’m afraid it’s too late; 2 1/2 months ago she separated from me and asked me to move out. She has found another man who personality-wise she says she’s not interested in, but they have amazing sex chemistry. 

Recently she has mentioned that she’s ready to file for divorce, but yesterday at the office when it came time to sign at the bottom, she couldn’t bring herself to do it. She says she’s not sure if it’s because she feels that a part of her still loves me and thinks we could work, if it’s because she’s afraid of simply losing the comfort of “what’s familiar to her” (we are still very close despite being so…separate, if that makes sense), or if she feels guilt for hurting me because I still love her so much. We’ve talked about it, and all 3 reasons have been mentioned and she doesn’t seem to be sure which is the real reason or how to move forward. 

I love her with all of my heart, and am doing everything in my power to be everything that she deserves. I am a great father, I provide 45% of the household income with prospects of making more and becoming the official breadwinner (which I think would mean a lot to her, as psychologically she feels like I’m a “dependent” since she makes more money than me), and we still get along very well as friends and are very open and honest communicators. I am proud of my sobriety, especially that in the face of our separation and her new fling I never once turned to any substance for coping. 

I am committed in maintaining the promises I made to her when we got married, for better or for worse. I will never give up on her or us. But I also respect her autonomy and her decisions. She thinks that any person in their right mind would be flying out of the door with the knowledge that their wife is flourishing sexually with someone else. She says she is sure she still loves me, but is not sexually attracted to me at all due to the past few years of me falling short in my responsibilities. 

I’m just not sure if I’m doing the right thing. She obviously isn’t against the thought of us loving each other, but is also obviously not currently attracted to me and is curious about enjoying her autonomy as a single person. How do I work towards trying to help us find “us” again, without putting emotional pressure on her to stay with me simply due to the guilt of “breaking my heart”? I have told her that I unequivocally respect her and her decisions either way, and will not fight her or pressure her to make a decision one way or the other. However I feel that simply the act of keeping hope and showing interest in having us work again is giving her guilt and affecting her ability to make the correct decision for herself. What do I do? Do I bite the bullet and accept that she is done with us, even though she says she’s not sure that she is, to give her the peace to move on? Do I keep my promise and continue being available while respecting her space and hope that one day she comes around? Of course I love her and want to be with her, but above that I want her to be happy. I just feel like I’m failing in that regard either way.

Tl;dr 9 year relationship started with extraordinary promise, fizzled due to my alcoholism; love and trust seems to still exist from both parties but is in the verge of collapse, and I don’t know if I should be working and showing dedication to her and our family, or accept defeat and stay silent so that she can leave without feeling guilt.",0,"My 34m wife 31f has separated from me, and wants to file for divorce, but can’t bring herself to do it.

relationship_advice," I told my parents about my BF who’s currently not in the same country as me. My parents weren’t too happy about the fact that I chose to get married to this guy citing his family as the issue. They suggested that his parents are too conservative and would be very difficult for me to keep up with.

I’m very certain that I want to marry by BF and I’m not too bothered about his extended family (my BF is very strong headed and rational person and I trust him on everything). He’s someone I can rely on and don’t doubt his capability to protect me.

How do I convince my family on our relationship. I’m sure there’s going to be pushback from his folks too, but I’m taking one day at a time!

relationship_advice,"I dated my ex for 5 years. We started dating as soon as we met. About 6-7 months into the relationship he reconciled with a friend he met abroad and had lost contact with when she moved into our city. They had a very romantic meeting story and it was obvious he was interested in her back then but he assured me I had nothing to worry about. Also he’s extremely attractive, like he gets hit on wherever he goes by random strangers. So I thought she wasn’t exactly his type that much because she was very plain looking.

I met her. We became fast friends. She was one of those “listens to understand not to reply” people so she was easy to talk to. I shared a lot with her about my relationship.

My ex broke up with me a year ago. He was very stressed at work and lost someone close to him and I had my own stuff going on so I wasn’t there as much as I wanted to be. But I also felt like he had fallen out of love with me for a while before the break up. It hurt a lot and I was truly a mess. I confided in my friend again.

Three months after she told me they have been seeing each other. She said it entirely started after we broke up but I’m not sure how it’s possible to go from friends to lovers in three months like that shortly after ending a long term relationship so I was pissed. It also didn’t help that she moved in with him a few months after that while he always told me he didn’t want to live together before his job becomes less demanding. He also introduced her to his family who live abroad which he never did with me. All of our friends were surprised because he’s always been rather distant with me (which I assumed was cultural because he’s Nordic) and now he is the complete opposite. So in summary, I completely flipped out and I also cut her off from our friend circle and we didn’t talk since.

However, now that it’s been a whole year. I kinda miss her and I’m mostly over the break up. So I’m wondering if I should reach out and try to reconcile. Also a friend I confided in recently said since I met her through him, it wasn’t the same level of betrayal it would have been if it was the other way around but honestly even though I know they were closer, we were still pretty close and it really felt like a huge betrayal at the time.

relationship_advice,"Hi, I would like some advice, as I'm struggling with what words to use to socialise my thoughts. My husband Jeff and I have been married for almost one year, and it's mostly been great. I would like to clarify a few things, Jeff is generally a very supportive partner; works full time, and he does do a share of the housework, but 50% of the time, he does need to be reminded or prompted to do them. I recognise this post does show him in a negative light, but I'm just frustrated right now and need some advice.

Jeff lost his license in a park with friends several years ago and has not gotten around to replacing it until this year. We are based in a major city in the UK, so getting around hasn't been an issue.  Several days ago, Jeff asked me to go to a post office and pick up a form to allow him to apply for a new license by post. I did this today and gave 2 copies of the same form to fill out. This evening, he asked for help filling it out, by help he wanted me to write out all the information because, in his words, ""your handwriting is better, you know how mine is."" 

I asked him to please at least have a look at the form and write out a draft in pencil to allow me to go over and double-check everything (simple, right?). He refused to do even that and insisted on me doing it; annoyed by his lack of initiative, I angrily told him to go get the forms and filled out the information for him, asked him for the extra relevant information, and ultimately double-checked the info needed to submit and dated the form. I did make him direct me to check off the correct boxes, and made him read out ID numbers basically asked all the questions while doing it for him.

My problem is his lack of involvement; every time he needs to fill in a form, or find important documents, or information for travel, it's the same thing ""Babe, can you do, this or that. You know your better at this than me.""  its mentally draining to always have to be on and paying attention, researching and reading all the information, I can't remember the last time he planned something that required zero involvement from me. Trying to info about his family events is like pulling teeth with him, and it makes me feel like a mother to him and not a partner; he lacks initiative and refuses to actively participate or lead in planning dates or anything, birthdays and special celebrations are particularly annoying as he never knows where he wants to go and rarely puts any effort in choosing and contacting other family members to actually go to these places. If I don't do these tasks honestly, we'd never leave the house.

I have already had similar discussions with him in past about our chores, and he always says the same thing ""I don't ask you to do these things; you don't have cook, or clean for me I can do those things myself"". The problem is that I do want to take care of him sometimes by helping out when I can, if he's had a busy week by cooking, and making sure he has clean clothes for work. And generally, I do so many things around the house, replacing our toiletries and cleaning supplies, and calling our landlord for repairs so he never has to think about them. But, if I have a busy week or month and miss something and it runs out, he will not replace it! He has gone weeks without replacing his deodorant because he keeps forgetting.

I'm tired of making so many decisions for myself and him, I feel like a secretary. We'd like to have kids in the future, and I really don't want to become a parent still teaching him how to be an adult, as I can see this becoming worse with a child involved.

Can anyone suggest any tips for discussing this in a non-confrontational and contractive way?

We’ve been dating for five months. 

We had a minor argument because I expressed concern and told him to go to the hospital bc he’s dealing with issues (inflamed nasal passages, bad headaches). 
He expressed how it’s not useful for him to go because there’s not much they can really do. Which okay, I understand that now after he explained it. 

But the way he went about saying it really hurt me. He expressed how he doesn’t do pain meds, and then said unlike me he wont take just about anything they give him (I have a history of mental illness, and tried several SSRIs). 

He then said do you ever wonder how you would be if you hadn’t taken them, in a condescending tone :( and I admittedly got defensive and just said no. One of the meds I took was the turning point of me getting better mentally. His response was something along the lines of well maybe you wouldn’t have a broken body.

This is because I struggle to reach orgasm after the SSRIs. He knows how insecure I feel about this. And when I expressed feeling hurt he told me well it’s true though. 

Is it valid for me to be hurt by his comment? Does he have a point. I don’t know what to feel besides hurt, but I don’t even know if I should feel hurt because.. he is right :( I don’t even know how to approach this with him, because he tends to view hurtful things as valid points if they’re right.

I've known that i liked girls for a while now and my fiance knows as well. Although i had never actually done anything with another girl. Our one rule was that as long as we were both present or at the very least knew about what was happening before hand we could pretty much do whatever we wanted.

 And i know what you're thinking, with a rule like that why would i go behind his back? I dont have an answer to that other than i never planned for things to play out the way they did and in the moment i was drunk and saw an opportunity to experiment with a girl. It wasn't worth it.

 They left after and i picked my fiance up from work. Immediately i was filled with guilt. I made it until tuesday when i called a friend that had worked with both me and the coworker and also knew my fiance and my coworkers girlfriend. I told her what happened and she agreed that the best thing for me to do was to tell him.

 I told him when we got home that night. I broke his heart and i dont think he can forgive me. I regret what i did so much and i want to prove to him that it wont happen again but he keeps saying he needs time. I understand that this is a lot and he needs time to think about it. I just wish i could take it back.

I know what i did was wrong and i feel so stupid for letting myself behave like that and throw everything away that we've worked for. We just moved into this house. Our first place together. And i ruined it. I dont blame him honestly and im very grateful that he's even taking the time to think about it. If the rolls were reversed i dont think i could forgive that. 

I just dont know what to do and needed somewhere to get this out. I will just have to wait and see if hes willing to give me another chance.

relationship_advice,"We have been dating for a little over three years now and been living together for most of our relationship. She very rarely dresses up beyond a hoodie and sweats. Sometimes a top and jeans/leggings. Around the house it is always sweats and a hoodie. I never had an issue in the beginning because I knew she had confidence issues and she was trying. Throughout our whole relationship, at certain times, I’ve pushed her to dress up more to help feel more confident. Its never helped or worked and I don’t push too hard because its not my place to tell her what to wear. I’m really struggling now because sex is becoming difficult. I can only think of her dressed up as a grey blob and its not sexy at all. I just dont know what to do anymore, I dont feel like I can help but at the same time I want to be attracted to my girlfriend. I find myself looking more at other women and i am envious of their confidence and fashion and that makes me feel less attracted to my girlfriend and makes me feel more disconnected to her as time goes on.

I (23f) and my boyfriend (24m) have been dating for like 3 months now. There haven’t been any red flags besides this. He’s great! But,a few weeks ago, we were talking about our hall passes. I said matthew mcconaughey, and he flipped his phone to show me his. It was a plastic, fake 90% naked girl with a huge ass’s page on instagram. Not famous but had a decent following. Kinda missing the point of a hall pass if you know what I mean? I said “ew” when he showed me lol. 

I dug into it a bit more, and he follows a BUNCH of these skanky half naked models on instagram who mainly post their huge butts and promote their only fans. Pages dedicated to butts in leggings and other bullshit. I’m fit, but I don’t have a humongous BBL like all these girls he follows. It’s honestly been eating away at me the past few weeks. Don’t know how to bring it up? He said in the past he doesn’t watch porn, but follows all of these naked girls with ginormous asses. In my opinion, I find it a lot worse.

relationship_advice,"TL;DR: Me and my bf have not been physical in a couple of months and I’m concerned that he may want to redefine our relationship. I need advice. 

I have been dating my boyfriend for over a year now &amp; things have been great.

We’ve had our ups and downs. Both of us are very ambitious &amp; career focused. There are moments where I’ve struggled with him being too busy with work, but over time I’ve learned to be patient with him. He usually makes up for the moments he feels that he’s not giving me enough attention. And I do the same when I see that I’ve haven’t been there enough for him.  Overall, we found a delicate balance that works for us. 

The past few months we’ve connected more than ever both emotionally and intellectually. He’s actually been helping me with a work project. I love that we can connect professionally. We learn alot from each other. 

He’s also opened up more with me about his family, childhood, and his last serious relationship. He’s been very vulnerable and I appreciate that he feels he can talk to me. We’ve also learned more about each others  communication styles. All that has been wonderful. 

However here’s the issue: lately we haven’t been physically intimate. It’s been an almost a couple of months now. And even before then, the last few sessions were short-lived, to say the least, and I could tell he was “doing it” almost out of obligation to me. 

We have somewhat talked about this issue. He’s told me that he hasn’t been in the right mental space for physical intimacy lately. He’s really been enjoying connecting with me on an emotional level. He said that he hopes to get in a better headspace soon.

I’ve been patiently waiting but, I haven’t seen any indication that he’s ready. Not only that, but it’s become hard for us to be physical in other aspects - such as kissing or cuddling. I can tell it makes him uncomfortable when I try to show a little physical affection. This breaks my heart because I hate that it might be making him uneasy.

The most recent incident is when we celebrated a work accomplishment last week. I saw that the night was going to end again without intimacy. Because it was a celebration, I didn’t make it a big deal to have a conversation about it. We enjoyed drinks, dinner, &amp; he hung out for a bit at my place before leaving. I understood this as he had family and friends in town - so I had expected it would be an “early night”. 

However after he left I did message him. Overall it was a sweet goodnight/“congrats again” message but I mentioned something about rekindling our physical relationship soon. 

To this he replied that it’s a discussion for another time, nothing bad,  just to clarify more or less, but he’s happy to have the talk. 

At first, I didn’t know what to think and how to respond to it. But I did respond fairly quickly. Again, because it was a celebratory occasion, I kept it nice, as to avoid any tension. I said I’m happy to discuss too but for now he should just enjoy his night and that we’ll talk soon.

So, I guess one good thing is that we have a discussion coming up. The downside is how much I’m overthinking in anticipation of it. 

I know he said “nothing bad” but I can’t help but think of all the bad things it could be - is he not physically attracted to me anymore?

Side note: he has dabbled in a poly relationships before and at the beginning, we discussed dating multiple people. Eventually, as we continued to date, we both mentioned that we would be exclusive. This was around the time we said the L-word to each other. 

However,  because he’s been poly before, has he changed his mind about being exclusive?

He did say he separated his relationships in the past between emotional/physical ones &amp; purely physical ones. He told me he was only being physical/emotional with me but, maybe he wants something different now?

relationship_advice,"Never thought I’d be asking the internet for marriage advice, but here we are. 

Husband and I have been married for five years, together for about seven. He is a wonderful, dedicated spouse and father to our children, but we have one reoccurring issue that we cannot seem to move past. Sometimes when we get into arguments about small annoyances (think: I forgot to add an appointment to the family calendar, or he forgot to drop clothes off at the dry cleaner), he will throw a grenade into the argument which requires us to sit down at length to discuss the major implications of his bombshell statement. More specifically, he will point to past behavior of mine to dismiss having to apologize for his current behavior, as if his prior hurt somehow justifies my current pain.

More often that not, the past hurt he cites is what I previously perceived as a completely benign scenario. As an example, about two and a half years ago, I noticed that he kept repeating that he couldn’t hear me or didn’t catch the tail end of what I was saying when I was speaking to him. His father is deaf in one ear, so I suggested he go get a hearing test done just in case. He got the test and the ENT amusedly informed him that he has perfect hearing and just needs to work on his attention span. 

Two years later, I called him out for saying something that hurt my feelings, and he explodes, “well, how do you think you made me feel when you made me get a hearing test?” I was flabbergasted. That hearing test had taken place a whole two years prior and frankly, I had zero idea that asking him to get his hearing checked ever made him feel some type of way. We then proceeded to have a long conversation about his resentment towards me, and I told him he needs to work on expressing his frustrations in the moment instead of letting that anger build until he blows up out of nowhere. 

Ultimately, I think his largest issue is that he seems unable to let go of past transgressions. Neither of us has done anything that cannot be forgiven up until this point (no infidelity, no vices, etc.), but he hoards his hurt like a squirrel in winter, and throws his stash in my face the minute I try to confront him about literally anything. 

The final straw fell last night, when I asked him for non-sexual physical affection. He told me he wasn’t in the mood, I accepted that, but I also mentioned that I feel like the issue of physical affection is a Catch-22 for us: either I feel unfulfilled (hugs and kisses are my love language) and his boundaries are accepted, or I feel fulfilled and his boundaries are disregarded. I asked if there was a scenario where we were both happy, and that’s when he tossed his grenade. 

He told me about how horrible it feels when I “constantly” harass him for hugs and kisses. He got emotional and described how he forces himself to hug me when prompted, and how I don’t respect his physical boundaries. 

I was so crushed that I almost vomited. I didn’t know how to respond, and the revelation completely destroyed my security in our marriage. I gave birth to our second child last year and had been feeling better about our physical relationship lately—we were finally having regular sex again and it felt like he had been intimating non-sexual physical affection. And to be told it was all a lie just broke me. 

When he saw me crying, he immediately backtracked and said he didn’t mean all the time. That he was only annoyed by requests for hugs specifically when he was busy doing something, but I can’t move on from this. I don’t know how to move on from this. How do I believe him when he says he doesn’t resent me for something, when I know in a couple months, that resentment will come back to bite my head off?",0,"Husband (49M) couldn’t forgive me, and now I (34F) can’t forgive him.",r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8870439,1682536799,0,1682536812,1682536812,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,12,688

Long story short we hangout, she is really into me, we started to hold hands, kiss, compliment each other, spend a lot of time with her and even come to her house to take care of her while she was sick but we weren't in a relationship, she never said that but the fact that we are kinda doing it and expect that in the future (at the time didn't know why and was afraid to ask). The Easter break was going to start so she went in her home town, so do in mine. From here things were starting to get worse, she wasnt answering so fast since she was very busy in that time with family and friends and told me like I'm the only one who s talking to so I appreciated the commitment and understood her. The break ends and I met her this Monday when I told that I missed her, but she said that wasn't kinda true for her. At this moment I told her that it could be seen and she had the perfect moment to confess myself that the things moved to fast and she told me that we should have been friends before everything and for her, and all we did wasn't the right way to start a relationship with her, because she wanted a friendship, first. I told her thats okay, I agreed with her philosophy.

relationship_advice,"So I've been through it in the last few years. I had a 7 year relationship break down and end in a (friendly) divorce in 2021. Although he and I ended on great terms, it was rough. Especially since I live in a foreign country and don't have much of a safety net. 

I quickly got in another relationship with a very passionate but emotionally disturbed man. It got very intense as his mental health fell apart and I had a bit of a burn-out after his second suicide attempt. The whole experience messed me up and we parted on very bad terms. 

I've been dating casually, and recently started the first serious-ish relationship I've had since. Over the past 1-1/2 months, I feel a strong chemistry- connection with this man. Physically, he is very intimate and it feels quite emotional. We spoke about the direction things are moving and he insisted I don't feel more than he does, and that we are on the same page, but he wants to go slow. 

He recently invited me to join some nights out with his family and friends and it went well. But he is a very bad texter, he will go almost 24-hours with no message to me. I don't need so much attention, but it's starting to bother me a bit. Tonight is a holiday in our country that people go out drinking. He has plans with his friends, and I sort of thought he'd invite me, but he barely talked to me all week. He didn't ask what I'm doing tonight, let alone ask if I want to celebrate together.

I'm feeling lonely in this early relationship, but I'm also afraid I'm just too needy. He comes across as quite cold sometimes, even though I think he cares for me. I don't know how to read it and I'm feeling really sad - which I think I shouldn't feel in the ""honeymood"" phase.

relationship_advice,"For reference, I’m 18 and my boyfriend is also 18 and we’ve been together since were 16 &amp; 17 (I, F18, am 5 months older.)

My boyfriend, let’s call him Jack, and I met at our summer job. We were friends for about 6 months before we started dating. The first 3 months of our friendship I was in a relationship with our boss. My ex and I broke up in August and I started dating my current boyfriend in December.

Now to the problems. The first few months of our relationship seemed great but now looking back on it I’m seeing some red flags. When we first started to go out and established we liked each other he was leading on one of his female friends who publicly made it clear she wanted him. She would make comments to him (which he told himself) like “you don’t actually like her” (referring to me)and just things that made it seem like he was giving her the impression that the feelings were reciprocal. He made it a priority to pick her up from school, drop her to work, and even tried to make me friends with her. When she eventually found out about me she was actually a great person and removed herself from the situation.

I looked past this as it didn’t seem like he liked her romantically and I also had male friends so I couldn’t make a big argument about it.

This was really our first problem but we kind of just overlooked it and continued on. Fast forward we’re about 4 months into our relationship in April. For reference, we were still working at the same job which my ex also worked at. My ex cheated on me and I had moved on from that before entering my current relationship so our work relationship was strictly just work and occasionally a little small talk if we were working together. Now, Jack, my current boyfriend, had never made it a problem to me about me working with my ex. However, he had brought it up to me in a sort of angry way that it made him uncomfortable to work with someone who I used to love. I found this to be reasonable and I validated the way he felt and I never worked a shift with my ex again.

Now to something that really began the decline of our relationship. But first, let's backtrack to when we were first friends before our relationship. Jack, my current boyfriend, trusted me and saw me as a good friend to talk about his problems with. He would often tell me about his ex from about a year ago let's call her Mary. Jack would tell me stories about the two, how much he wanted their relationship to work and just basically was obsessed with the idea of her. However, Mary saw my bf as just a friend and they only hooked up once ( they never had sex.) I found it weird that Jack had never told me about any of the girls he had been with sexually when we were friends but he rather told me about this girl. I saw her as basically his first love and qualified her as an ex, even though they had never been sexual.

Now to the problem, it was the day of my senior prom. The happiest day a high school girl looks forward to. The day started great with him meeting my mom and taking our pictures and stuff. We went to a pregame and maybe we had a little too much to drink but we headed to prom regardless. When we arrived at prom I ran into an old friend (male) who was brought as a date to my prom. As the night progressed I saw a mood change in Jack and asked him what was wrong. He began to speak to me sternly and almost angrily asked me if that old friend I ran into was somebody I had sex with in the past. I reassured him that it wasn’t (it da wasn’t) and that he didn’t have to worry. From that point on the prom was ruined, I was upset he would even bring up a conversation like this AT MY PROM, and the way he didn’t even fix his attitude after. As the night progressed my phone died and I asked him if I could call my mom on his. (For reference, we were never the couple to go through each other’s phone) I saw him clear a message and he thought I didn’t see. I asked him who it was and he quickly started apologizing and making excuses. I knew at that moment it was his ex, Mary. The night was ruined and we left my prom early. He called me later and began to cry saying he was sorry for ruining my night and saying he would understand if I wanted to break up with him.

The next day we saw each other and he explained he would talk to her sometimes, as friends, just catching up. He then put up an argument that they never had sex so it wasn’t even his ex and that it was his first real relationship so he didn’t know he wasn’t allowed to talk to her. I found it funny he could even say that even though he asked me not to talk to my ex and just before I found out about him and Mary he was starting an argument about me talking to my old friend.

Call me an idiot but I justified the argument he put up and stayed with him. Guys, please let me know who is in the wrong, me or him!

Let’s continue, so we’re now in August and he still hasn’t unfollowed Mary on Instagram. Jack and I had been having a rocky summer as he couldn’t understand I couldn’t get over what he had done. It ate me up as I realized he was projecting because he was talking to his ex.

I’m just gonna include some minor stuff that happened during that summer. I found out he was secretly hanging out with a female friend and taking her to the gym even though I had asked to go with him and he said no. He went to a party by himself with his friend who is a known whore and told me it was a guy's party. He ended up ignoring me half the night and it turned out to be a female's party. He went to Florida and told me to stay home while he was gone but went to bars with his friends.

At this point, I had lost a majority of my friends because they were males and he didn’t trust me to talk to them. Also, what little female friends I did have, he made it clear he didn’t want me to hang out with them because they had high body counts.

My mental health began to decline when I started my first year of UNI bc I had no one but my boyfriend and I eventually ended up dropping out due to how severe it was getting. I had tried talking to Jack about it a couple of times but he brushed it off as a phase. He even made the argument that growing up you eventually start to have no friends. With no contact with anyone other than Jack, I believed him.

This was until October, the day my feelings for him were never really the same. It was a big concert festival that wasn’t too far from us with some of our favorite artists so we decided to go. The day started great with us and excited and we pregamed at his house. Now, I know my boyfriend gets a bit more aggressive and fatigued when he drinks so I asked him not to drink much as this was something I wanted to enjoy and not babysit him. We arrived at the concert and all was well as moved from set to set. It was getting later in the night when he said he wanted a beer, specifically a beer that was 14%. He made the argument that it was hard to enjoy sometime like this sober and it wouldn’t affect him. He ended up chugging the beer and was very intoxicated. He began to start arguments with other people in the crowd and I was getting visibly upset with him. He was also embarrassing, dancing all over the place, bumping into people who were also irritated by him. He then asked me if I had a problem and all hell broke loose. I answered yes and he quickly pulled me off to the side where he began screaming at me. People around me looked concerned but said nothing. He called me a whore and was screaming at me that I needed to stop bothering him because he was struggling with his own problems of dating a whore. This continued and he never stopped screaming and would pull me aggressively. We eventually left the concert and got on the train where this continued. He began to tell me we were done and he called me disgusting names. He forced me against a wall and forced me to say “I’m a whore” among other things. This finally ended when he shoved me into a parked car and a woman came out screaming he would call the cops. He shoved me again when I fell I was left with a bruised knee and Uber home.

I was done with him. That was until he called me 30 minutes later and said if I didn’t forget about that tonight and stay with him he would share videos with my family and friends of us having sex. (He was still clearly drunk on the phone) I complied in fear and pretended to say yeah it’s fine.

The next morning he called me to talk in person, still in fear I agreed. He said he doesn’t remember much about the night before and apologized and he said it was just the drunkness that made him say those things.

Yep, I stayed with him out of fear of being alone and that maybe he would actually leak our tapes.

I won’t talk about much after because he just kinda wanted to pretend it never happened and that was the point I realized I needed to become better.

Fast forward to now. I’m doing much better, my mental health is better, I’m back on track in school, and my overall confidence has been better as I lost 20 pounds and got a job.

The things he does still replay in my head every day. Anytime he asks me to hang out or when we’re in person I just have so much resentment for him but he’s different now. He’s almost like a dream guy but I just can’t reciprocate. I know that I’m hurting which I don’t want to but it feels almost good too. Being with him for more than an hour drives me insane and I'm easily provoked by him. But when I think about breaking up with my heart crumbles. I’m not saying I’m unhappy with him but I feel stuck in the past. I don’t know what to do, someone help me because I still haven’t made friends yet.

relationship_advice,"So I want to get my ex back. Our relationship is a bit special so I don’t know what to do. First of all I am m21 and she f43. We have a long distance relationship as she lives in a neighbouring country but we would see each others every 2-3 months. I was planning to study in her city in order to be closer to her but she says she doesnt want to wait so long and its devastating me. She says she wants to live a normal life and that our age difference makes it very difficult. I should search for someone in my age when I start studying. I really want her back and I think the relationship is worth fighting for. These reasons and the fact that I have been very jealous sometimes apparently made her think its better to break up with me. I am just so shocked because everything seemed to be alright before and suddenly she said she wants to break up. When she first wanted to break up on Sartuday I said I am the man and I decide the things and I decide not to break up. I know this sounds odd for many people but often when decisions were to be made she said that I am the man and have to decide the things. So I did. Things seemed to be alright and she even suggested to visit me only that an hour later she would want to break up again. I tried to convince her not to do it but she wants it. She said she has no problem continuing talking to me but she would understand if I dont want. Should I go no contact out of the blue? Should I announce it? Should I apologize?

relationship_advice,"I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (32M) for seven years now. Our sex life was pretty great, we would have it multiple times a day and we were both happy and satisfied. It all started going wrong about a week ago when I received some devastating news. My last remaining Grandparent (My Grandmother who is also one of my best friends) was rushed into hospital and then diagnosed with late stage 4 cancer and was given less than two months to live. I was completely in shock, as were most of my family as no one had any idea that she was that ill. I had just lost both of my Great Grandmothers two months apart and the last one only passed two months ago. Then two weeks ago my family dog of more than 15 years was found passed away in her bed. I feel like I’ve become completely numb, I can’t feel anything anymore. I feel lost, broken, scared and I can’t help but keep breaking down. My boyfriend has been supportive… Until it comes to sex. 

Up until two days ago we were still doing it once a day, I wasn’t really in the mood and he knew this but I tried my best to keep him happy and make sure he didn’t feel pushed to the side. It created a lot of arguments and friction between us because he still wanted to do it multiple times a day but I just couldn’t. It’s gotten to the point where he won’t stop pressuring me and trying to make me feel guilty for not being in the mood until I start yelling and crying and then he walks off angry and says some hurtful things. He’ll sit next to me and ask if we can do it and when I say I’m not really in the mood right now but maybe later he’ll keep talking dirty to me trying to turn me on and even ask why I don’t want him anymore and if there is someone else. I’ve never cheated on him and I never will. He says I should be grateful that I have a man who wants me and only me and that I’m pushing him away because I keep turning him down. The last two days have been like hell. I’ve really been struggling to keep up and even doing it once a day I have to really force myself and I feel like I’m beyond my breaking point. Even in the past when I wasn’t completely in the mood I would still give in to make him happy because I know how upset he gets so maybe I’ve created this for myself and I deserve it. But the last couple of days when he doesn’t get what he wants he says some really hurtful things about me and even my Grandmother. He’s told me that I’m becoming an old granny because I don’t get wet for him anymore (which isn’t true) and that I’m not the one for him because I won’t give it to him whenever he wants. He’s told me I’m only upset because my Grandmother is dying and that my whole family is surrounded by death and I’m using that as excuses. This morning when he tried and I said no he lost his shit and told me ‘tell your grandmother to take a one way ticket to upstairs already’ and then stormed out. I’ve taken a lot of shit from him but this has hurt me beyond anything else and I can’t ever see myself truly forgiving him. 

I feel silly and embarrassed for posting this here because I have a feeling what some of the comments are going to be, but I guess I needed to hear it for myself. I can’t talk to my family about it because I don’t want to worry them as they’re already going through a lot, so I guess I just need some advice.

Is it ever okay for a parent to tell their child that they hope they do not have children in the future because they never want them to know the hurt of being called a retirement plan? Then you call them out for saying something hurtful and their reasoning is ‘well you don’t want kids anyway’.  I did at one point, and she knew that.

(As for telling her I’m not her retirement plan, I did say that – she had told me she had expected me to stay with her until she died and that was my response back. Was it insensitive? Yes, and I admit that but I also have already told her I’d never say it again per her request.)

Is it ever okay for a parent to tell their child that they hope they die before their child gets married, because the parent doesn’t want to have to make the decision to go or not because they hate the person their child would be marrying. Then you call them out for saying something hurtful again and their response is ‘I’m just an asshole, bitch, too blunt, insensitive ect.’ Listing out all the things they’ve been called in the past by people I’m assuming.

Is it okay for a parent to let their emotions get the better of them and chock it up to ‘bitch kitty comes out to play, I have no control of what I say?’ I was always told if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say it at all.  

All of these things I personally believe you should never tell your child, I feel it is blatantly hurtful considering those are two big days in a persons life. My mother says that she’s just expressing her feelings and that it’s not meant to be hurtful. I don’t see any other way it can be taken though? She said she never expected me to be so fragile, I don’t think I’m being fragile though? I just don’t want to be spoken to like that.

My mother and I have a very strained relationship right now, I am in therapy and my therapist says that she is toxic, manipulative, and controlling. I am in the process of moving in with my bf (who she hates, though she cant tell me why – just tells me he’s weird and she gets a bad gut feeling.) Through this process of me moving she’s just gotten worse. She says she feels like he is taking me away from her, that he is turning me against her and that I am a different person now. She blames him for me calling her out on things, when really it’s my therapist telling me to stand up for myself since normally I let my mom say and do what she wants and I just suck it up and hold my tongue. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m tired of it and I’ve been told this is not a normal dynamic. My boyfriend says she’s a narcissist and emotionally abusive, my best friend says she is controlling, manipulative and gaslighting me. Both are on my side though which can sway their feelings.

relationship_advice,"Growing up my (25f) oldest brother (32m) was plain mean. Not in the typical older brother way either. He would constantly find ways to physically hurt me and my siblings. Once I became a teenager, he would comment on my appearance (my hair was ugly, I should wear makeup, etc) and he would constantly criticize me for not following the same path as him (underage drinking/partying, joining a frat, being mean to my parents). He’s always made it his goal to make you feel like crap about yourself.

relationship_advice,"TLDR: Wife gained weight over course of marriage and it’s leading to intimacy issues, do I tell her, that her weight gain is causing me to lose sexual interest in her?

I (M25) and my wife (F24) have been together for around 5 years. Like others over lockdown we both put on a bit of weight (~20 for me, maybe ~45 for her). It got to the point where I was disgusted looking at myself in the mirror so I started going to the gym 3-5 times a week and I still go. My wife insists that her weight is due to our diet and that she would only lose weight through dieting and that the gym is pointless for her so she doesn’t bother. Our sex life before the lockdown was pretty healthy, at least twice a week. But since we let ourselves go and I got back in shape I have to force myself to do it maybe once a month or 2 months. And it’s usually due to her breaking down that she feels unwanted and like I don’t love her ganymore.

relationship_advice,"My [30] ex girlfriend [30] took off about four months ago. We were together for four years. I met her shortly after both of my parents passed away. Shortly after losing mom and dad, I also exited an abusive relationship and was arrested and charged with false accusations. It was a dark time for me. I was ready to take the easy way out, and was planning to for some time.

We met on Facebook. She was my best friend’s girlfriends friend. We had a very strong connection, from when we met. We communicated everyday. She brought me out of my shell and helped me loosen up and connect with people (her family).

She pulled me out of my depression. She came to visit me often, and eventually started living with me.

A few months in, we started talking about a house and kids.

I’m a pretty straight forward guy. I partied in high school and college. At this point in my life, I was looking to take some time off (due to my recent loss) and focus on getting my life back together.

She was my rock, for the first couple years.

Why did I find her interesting? I saw a picture of her, and she looked beautiful. She is beautiful. She’s the prettiest women I’ve ever been with. Also, she finished a bachelors degree in Nursing. This was huge for me. I have a lot of respect for educated women, who work.

At this point in my life I was in such a low that I did not have many hobbies other than video games and I spent way too much of my time with her. I didn’t have an identity.

Since she left, I have more friends. I have more hobbies and interests.

Not long after we met, I realized she likes to drink. Two of her friends warned me about it. Verbally. One of them warned me about it the first time we met. Her father also commented on it one night when she went a bit overboard. She likes to party.

It wasn’t a huge a deal to me. I really liked this girl (and still do). But eventually, it got to the point where it really started to have an effect on me.

There were two sides to it. One, she was a hell of a lot of fun. And two, when she would go overboard and make herself sick, it would upset me. And the amount and speed at which she would consume alcohol, if she went out to party, there’s no hope for relationship trust at that point.

Here is an example: One night she drank 750 ml of vodka. One night she drank two bottles of wine. A normal night of drinking would be eight beers plus.

She is 5′2, 140lbs. Also, she was on anti-depressant medication, which if you don’t know, it enhances the effects of alcohol and can be dangerous when mixed.

These examples are just drinks at home, hanging out at home or at the cabin. I actually only went out with her a few times.

After the bottle of vodka, she spent two days sleeping. Sometimes after drinking too much, you couldn’t speak to her because she didn’t know how to talk. Or know where she was. In a comfortable state. One night she pulled down her pants and almost peed on the kitchen floor because she did not know where she was.

I never put her down for this. The only time I gave her shit was when she drank so much that she was sick for days, and it would worry me. Obviously, I care about her health and want the best for her.

After meeting her family, I learned that her cousin(s) cheated on their boyfriends. I learned that her ex best friend cheated on her boyfriend and vice versa. And I learned that her mother is provocative. This is a recipe for disaster for my personal morals and values.

Understand that although this was definitely not my ideal situation, I still loved her family and friends regardless, and was happy to meet them and spend time with them. I just knew that this wasn’t the right situation for me. As I’ve gotten older, I don’t like to drink anymore. I don’t like to party. I place strong values on monogamy and trust. I enjoy the simple things now. The simple things in life. I place emphasis on diet, nutrition, hobbies, keeping a stable household, having a stable life and building stable friendships and relationships. I like family activities. Going to the park. Going bowling. Playing cards, playing board games. Watching movies. Also, I love to be around people who drink. I love drinking games. I’ll just drink a soda instead of alcohol. I can enjoy myself without drugs and alcohol. It’s something I’ve learned as I’ve gotten older and started to try to enjoy a more stable life.

Given these scenarios, I’ve already understood that there’s no hope that she could go out and party safely. I would worry. About her safety. About infidelity. She’s a party girl. It’s her nature. Given her habits, her nature, her friends and family, she isn’t the right girl for me. She would go well with a man who likes to party as well. A man who is as lighthearted as her.

I’d like to mention that I had more fun with her than I’ve had with any other friends. When she drank and partied, she was always happy. She would play music, and sing and dance. I wouldn’t drink, any. I loved to add songs to the playlist, sing and dance with her, and show her a good time. I’ve only ever done this in the comfort of our home. I was too shy to loosen up around friends or family. I wish I could have learned to do that. Maybe one day.

Eventually, I changed to an office job and she didn’t like that (Judgmental and not supportive of what I wanted in life). She stopped cleaning up after herself. She started hoarding. Items and animals. She decided she didn’t want or love me anymore after a couple years. I was too straight. And too hard on her. I guess I lost a lot of ambition after going through so much trauma. She was my rock and I leaned on her too hard.

Maybe it would have worked out if I knew how to loosen up. But she is very light hearted and carefree. A free spirit. I’m quite the opposite. I crave stability and comfort. I think that’s natural after experiencing trauma (losing both of my parents and having an abusive ex girlfriend).

I forgot to mention that she cheated on me VIA social media. Before we met, they met on Tinder and had a date. While we were together, she texted him and told him I was her boyfriend and that we had sex. He told her about his girlfriends. This seemed to build as a sort of jealous competition. You can see where this is going. This was at a point in our relationship where I literally thought she was the one and that we were meant to be. This was the strongest and most emotional relationship I’ve ever had. The connection was more than I can put into words. I’m not sure if it was mutual, but I certainly felt it.

I still love her to this day. I’ve never experienced such a strong relationship and such a fun individual. Her energy fills up a room. You can feel it. Her smile is captivating. I won’t ever forget it. There’s too much to write.

I think I made the right decision pushing her away. She doesn’t seem like the wife material. And I say this with respect. And I told this to her in person, a while ago. She doesn’t clean up after herself, she likes to party, and she doesn’t take much of anything in life seriously, other than her job. Although she played the part well, she had two different sides to her. A sweet, reasonable women and a party girl.

I trust my intuition. I trust my gut feelings. I trust that it was the right decision. But it still eats me up, everyday. No matter how much you infatuate and love someone, they may not be right for you. No matter how much I wanted things to work, and work my way, EVEN if I was flexible to what she wanted, I felt I could never trust her. And I trust my intuition.

If you made it this far, this is my story and my heart and feelings on a daily basis. It plays over and over again. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Please leave any thoughtful feedback.


Tl;dr: I pushed away my ex due to our incompatibilities, relationship issues, and lack of trust.

relationship_advice,"Throwaway cause my boyfriend knows my main and checks it *obsessively.*

There's so many elements to this situation I'm not sure where to begin. The short of it is that my boyfriend has been unemployed for 5 months now while I've held 2 simultaneous jobs and taken the huge brunt of our living expenses. THERE'S ALOT MORE DETAIL TO THIS that makes this more complex and hence why I'm having trouble figuring out if I'm justified in feeling as disgusted as I currently feel or if I'm wrong and totally blind. 

**His situation:**  
He works in a well-paying field with a lot of uncertainty. Layoffs in his field are very common, and usually expected for 1-2 months every year. This year however, the layoff was much longer. Usually, workers are re-hired by the same company once there's work again. When he works, he makes (an annualized) amount of maybe $150-180k/yr. Of course, if he's out of work for 5 months then he makes less because he's not working as many hours but it's still a nice amount. I think even working 8 months he'll still clear maybe $120k. He saves essentially ALL OF HIS MONEY- like upwards of 90%- and has always been a super cheapskate with me. Usually that bothers me but not a ton because I'm also a huge saver. But even when he was working, I'd have to beg for him to agree to a restaurant every 3 weeks or so and even then we always split the bill evenly. I make more money than him but have the potential to make much more because of my career path whereas he is currently pretty much maxed out. 

**My situation:**   
I make a bit more money than him but also run a business on the side. Between the two, I'll clear maybe 200k-250k/yr. However, what really sets my situation apart is that my business is in real estate. So while the business cashflows but not that much, the real gains are in assets gained. Over the last couple of years, I've put $2M under my name (aka rentals.) My business/second job consists of me taking care of said rentals. All the property is mine and mine alone. All expenses are out of my pocket.   


**Before the 4-month unemployment:**   
A few months before he got laid off we moved into a new place I had just bought. The place was huge for us (3 rooms, 2 baths) and totally empty. Since we had nothing, I had to furnish everything. Here's a kicker/conundrum: my plan was to live in this house for maybe 1 year and then move back to my home state to be closer to family. I was planning to rent this as a furnished rental then. Since I was going to rent this house, and since I was going to rent it furnished, ***my boyfriend refused to pay for any furnishings.*** I'm talking anything at all. ***Every table, every towel, every curtain, every fork in this house was bought by me.*** His logic is that since this house will soon be a business and produce ME (and only me) money, he didn't want to spend any money in buying, say, a sofa, that will go to MY business and make ME money. I agreed with this logic for big-ticket items like a sofa or a TV, but felt much more wronged and confused by small every day items like kitchen towels. Ultimately, he paid nothing and I furnished the entire house from scratch by myself. I spent several thousand dollars doing this. From his end, he says I'm lucky I get ""free labor"" from him. He does help me, in say, bringing a bed upstairs. That is heavy labor that if I paid for it would be very expensive. But I also feel that if I had any other boyfriend, that it'd be expected that the boyfriend would help carry a bed upstairs- especially if the girlfriend is paying 100% of the costs financially. So in the end: we moved in into MY new house, i paid for 100% of all furnishings from scratch, he helped me in physically getting the place together.   


**The 5-month unemployment:**  
Initially, we thought this would be 3 months. It ended up been 4 and counting. For the first 3 months, we traveled abroad. Initially, we split the costs 50/50, but slowly I ended up paying for most of it. I don't know what the math is but maybe I ended up paying for 70% of all costs while he paid the other 30%. Traveling for 3 months is a huge luxury and expensive and we're very grateful for the opportunity. I was working the entire time (and getting paid) and he wasn't hence the money distribution. 

Having said that, now we're 5 months into his unemployment and beginning to take a strong toll on me. I understand been unemployed and not wanting to spend money- at the same time, he has over $100k in his checking account. He refuses to go to even a restaurant and has essentially given me 2 options: if we go, either I take the FULL bill (cause he's unemployed) or I go by myself and he cooks himself something nice. 

Obviously it feels TERRIBLE to go out to a restaurant for dinner and leave my boyfriend at home so I don't do that. Of course when we go out to eat I take the whole bill. 

Again, I understand he's unemployed. But he also has $100k in his checking right now. He can't pay $30 for a dinner???

At the same time my business has been growing and every time I reach a new milestone it feels like my boyfriend is ***angry and hurt.*** It's obvious from his facial expression and body movements. He usually goes away for a bit and a few days later can talk about the milestone normally. 

Another thing is that he smokes weed everyday (I've never smoked.) Usually, this would have been a deal breaker but with him I let it slide. But now, combined with the unemployment, I feel that I'm maintaining this guy that's been fully unemployed for 5 months and his excuse is that I make a good living. I've been working 2 jobs (main day job and business) while he has none. HIS FRIENDS HAVE OFFERED HIM WORK. Nothing huge- just little day jobs here and there. He has declined all of them because he says his company is gonna call him back any minute and he's gonna regret using up his free time while he has it. 

Sighs. Am I in the wrong? Am I been used? Are both my boyfriend and I assholes?

relationship_advice,"I'll try to keep it short but there are a few moving parts. I'm from the US but moved to Mexico in 2019. In the pandemic met a woman from South America and we had probably the best chemistry I've ever experienced. To sum up, tons of laughs and silliness, getting along so great, so much affection, feeling so safe and real and happy together, and just having fun doing whatever. We basically started living together from the day we met. Fast forward a few months and I start feeling the same way I always have in relationships because (as I realized later) I never really took them seriously for various reasons. All of this is to say I got bored because we'd been stuck inside together, overexposed to each other, smoking weed and drinking every day, and I got too fixated on some of her, I wouldn't exactly call them flaws but certainly challenges for me, which I'll sum up at the end.

We next go through a long limbo period where I naively tried to force a platonic friendship and she just completely ignored all the rules/boundaries we tried to make to just be friendly and move on from each other, and as a result we were kind of half-together, half-not for about a year and a half. During a long period where we're not talking she moved to the US to join her parents and sister (as was her plan for a while). We briefly reconnected last September when she came back to Mexico to get rid of some stuff in her old apartment and from there she began half-jokingly pressuring me to move to where she was. I told her there was no way right now because I'd just resigned my lease and kinda felt like my life was here now (remember this is off of 6-7 months of not talking and trying to move on). But we haven't been able to move on from each other. After a tough convo about a possible restart of the relationship that didn't end well last October, we stopped talking for another 5-6 months and both got back to trying to get over each other. But still never got over each other. 

During this time I've decided I want to date more with purpose now and not just go out with someone cute from the apps and keep things casual, see multiple people, etc. I really would like to try building something with someone who can eventually be like my best friend. And well, she and I have some kind of magic that I've never felt before and I keep having this feeling that I really need to see how far things can go with her because she's so special.

So after a few tough conversations and her rebuffing one of my efforts to get us talking again very recently, she finally relented when I said I was willing to be open to moving to where she was. She even came to stay with me at my parents' house while I was visiting them a week ago and we had many convos about what a possible future would look like and I felt mostly positive about them. We've talked about doing a month or six-week trial where she is if we can get a temporary rental/Airbnb (big if unfortunately). So that could be the next step. But since we've gotten into the weeds on how things would actually move forward and I'm envisioning myself actually doing this, I have a few huge doubts. I'll try to cover each briefly:

\- I feel like our conversation is a little thin when it comes to deeper topics, especially social/political issues, something about which I'm tremendously passionate. It's just not something she cares a lot about and I always saw myself with someone with whom I could share that. We don't have to agree on everything but being able to discuss it a little at least is big for me. This may rub some the wrong way but I've sometimes felt like she's not a very deep thinker in general, although we've been high and in goblin mode together more often than not. I would also say our communication needs work in general though. Her English is getting a lot better and my Spanish is pretty good but I dunno, there is still some disconnect. Part of that has to do with her being a bit distracted/absent-minded generally, and she acknowledges this and says she wants to work on it. We both want to reduce phone time. Part of all this has to do with the fact that we've now spent a good chunk of time communicating long-distance w/ text and that's always worse.

\- Begging ppl not to troll on this one but I am a vegan of many years and she is not vegan. If you're vegan you'll understand why it's just not the same when someone is not vegan, even if they're very understanding and respectful (which she is). And I honestly can't say whether I can see her caring enough to do make that decision herself :( And probably even if you're not vegan you might be able to imagine why this is all a huge deal for me. I've always seen myself with someone with whom I can share that too.

\- Out of a need to distract herself from us and from other crappy circumstances, and a desire to meet people in a new city, etc, she has been pretty active in hookup culture (I have been too in Mexico, although ofc stopped when I was with her and slowed down a lot by late last year) and she made some comments before our last meeting that suggested that maybe she wasn't 100% sure about giving up the single life or whether she'd stay happy with just one person and it worried me. During a recent talk she said it ""might be necessary"" to do a threesome at some point (with another woman, she insisted) to keep things interesting. I do think hookup culture, porn etc. warps your brain and is making it more difficult for everyone to have healthy romantic relationships. Remember I've been active in it too. My attraction to her is strong; I find her totally gorgeous but I do have anxiety around avoiding being attracted to other people forever, around keeping our attraction fresh, etc. And I really don't want to move somewhere just to have someone decide (or for me to decide) they still just want to date around if they get bored for a little bit.

\- I'm fighting addiction, depression, and anxiety, and yeah I have friends who are worse but I've been in a pretty big rut for years and I sometimes think I won't be happy in any situation until I take care of this stuff and I don't know how viable that is if I'm trying to make a very serious relationship, possibly my last relationship for a very long time (or maybe ever! That's scary), succeed. So I wonder if I shouldn't just say I'm sorry but it's still not the right time. I should've taken care of these issues over the last two years but I simply failed to.

i've never gotten any weird vibes from mark, always just thought he was a cool guy. we have some similar interests and attend the same culinary school, which we bonded over initially. 

however, mark and i rarely interact. aside from saying hi and bye, i don't even talk to him unless he's with my boyfriend. but yesterday, he told my boyfriend that i was flirting with him a lot in school.

that literally never happened. mark did approach me at my station yesterday, which was uncommon, but i didn't think anything of it. we talked about something funny that happened the day before, he made a joke about it and i laughed and that was it.

relationship_advice,"My situationship and i have been hooking up. I don’t know if we are just friends with benefits. It’s difficult for me because of my overthinking and looking into everything. He comes over to my house, we’ve gone to dinner, gone dancing together, etc. It’s difficult for us to party together (both college students) because I’m not of age to drink and have no interest in purchasing a fake ID or getting an MIP/MIC. 

The way he talks to me when we do talk is great. He’s not the “always on his phone type” like me, so our conversations can be scarce. We’re light and flirty and the sex is great. He came over (for sex, we both clarified that) but stayed up talking with me until 3 in the morning. We laid in my bed singing our favorite songs together. 

It’s confusing to me because I don’t know if it’s an act. Up until now, i figured it was, but when he saw someone hitting on me at the gym, he later brought it up again and when i told him what this guy was saying to me, he laughed and said “he was trying to take my girl”. But we’ve had no clear conversations about what we are. He, unprompted, showed me his snapchat recent chats and said “see? I have no bitches” because I often tease him regarding a joke he made once that he had to leave my place early (it was 3:30 am) to go to another girl’s house. He got a notification that he had a new tinder match and showed me the notification? We both have tinder still, but I don’t use mine. 

 we only hang out once or twice a week. Other than that, we only see eachother at the gym everyday, and we don’t chat much. Just wave and have a short conversation, and always find the other to say goodbye before we leave. 

I just don’t want to feel deceived. When we laid in my bed and just sang our favorite songs together, I felt happy and loved. When he looks and talks to me, it feels sincere. He says things nobody had ever told me before, and tells me the things I’m insecure about are beautiful. He’s never called me hot. He calls me cute, beautiful, or pretty.

relationship_advice,"To understand everything we have to start from the beginning. Before this chick I never had any type of relationship or anything with a girl before. It started in late July, she slid up on one of my ig stories and made a comment. I responded thinking nothing of it. Mind you I went to highschool with this girl and had a class w her. So we start talking and late August we watch a movie and things hit off. Long story short we end up liking each other a lot. Since I never experienced this I wanted to convince myself I was just as happy before I met her. I do think she fell in love with me and it kind of scared me. I think I had issues with commitment because I've always seen my friends with long term gfs. Anyways, I then stopped talking to her early September and she understood. I reached back out to her around 3 weeks later just to say hi. We start talking again and we hang out more. I realized my mistake and I really liked this girl. I apologized to her for kind of ghosting her and explained my pov. Flash forward its April and we are still talking and hanging out. When we see each other it's probably once a week at most. Eveyrtime she comes over she says I make her feel sad because I show her all this attention and treat her right I'm assuming, and she says I deserve someone that treats me like a king. When she doesn't keep up w me like text or talk to me she also says sorry about that. Last time I saw her she told me I was like a dream to her, I really like this girl and told her I love her before. She's told me it before too. Y'all think she is just confused about us? Tbh I don't know what to do, I want her to be my gf and she has told me she is confused and not sure if its the right time.

relationship_advice,"How do I convince my husband that I am not his free personal maid?

Sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language and I am stupidly angry.

My husband (33 M) and I (31 F) have been married for 3 years and since we started living together we have always had this constant dumb problem, his dirtiness. 

My husband comes from a really small household, only 3 people, they lived in a big house with lots of space and had enough money to hire a maid twice a week. My MIL never taught him to do anything (FIL is not it the picture), to the point that he didn't even knew how to sweep when I first met him. If it is cause she's misogynistic, cleaning is a woman's job, o cause she's classist, cleaning is a poor man job, it up for debate, and that is for another story. To my husband's credit when we moved together he wanted to know how to do everything.

I, in the other hand, have a different background. I have always lived in a tiny little apartment with all my family (5 people and a dog). Our apartment was really close to a foodmarket and we had really dirty upstairs neighbors so we had to step up in being clean and organized cause pests were always a problem. Luckily when I was 17 my father got a promotion so we moved to a bigger apartment, but we stayed really clean.

Now that we live together we rented an apartment near where my childhood home was, and in consequence near the foodmarket. I WARNED him about the pests but he always told me that we will be ontop of the mess. When we started living together I lost my job, thank you Covid, so I stayed as a housewife and kept everything clean, cause I hate roaches with all of my heart, I know how a roach infestation feels and I never want to be I that position again. 

But my husband is messy, dirty dishes, clothes thrown everywhere, never doing the bed, putting everything just on top of drawers and closest without putting it away in order, you get the picture. He has this habit that is driving me mad of keeping every box and bag that he has, even though I have talked to him that our apartment is small and we have to be really efficient with the space we have.

Like half a year ago I finally got a job, I work from home, but anyone of you that also works from home knows that it's not like you have a ton of free time to keep a house clean. My husband works outside at an office.

Today was the day that I dreaded so bad, while I was feeding our dog I moved a box and there it was, a freaking monster family size roach staring back at me. As I could I tried to kill it cause you know once you take your eyes away those things disappear and it is imposible to find them again. But as I was taking of my shoe that little bastard started running and it vanished, I moved everything inside the room until I find it but I missed and that little b*tch run inside my husband's closet.

Victory, I thought, that thing is as good as dead. And I opened my husband's closet.

To say it was dirty as fuck is an understatement. His clothes were all thrown in there, a lot of empty boxes and trash, everything with a thick layer of dust, there was even a f*ucking toothbrush. (I'm forbidden from this closet cause is my husband stuff and his responsibility)

I moved all my meating of the day and got to clean the stupid closet cause I had to find the roach before it made a nest. I killed it, but lost 2 hours of my day in the process.

I called him to say wtf with his closet, that I was organizing it and I was going to throw away all the trash and do you know what he said to me? To leave it alone, he will clean eventually and i can't touch his stuf. Dude I told him to clean it like 2 months ago, cause I knew that something like this was going to happen and he promised me that we has going to do it, obviously he didn't.

My point is that I am done with his mess, every day I'm super tired cause I have to balance the house and my job while he comes like a hurricane and ruins everything every time he comes back home. It's like he can even see the dirtiness, or think about the consequences of living in a mess, BTW he has never killed a bug cause it's ""disgusting"", I have to come a kill everything

How do I tell him that I am not a housewife anymore, that I hate being his free maid (cause at least maids get paid) and that the next time I see his dirty things I am going to throw them away I don't care if he wants them or not.

Thank you for any advice, I am so mad and now I have to put the house upside down to see if that thing came alone or if it was from a nest.",0,"I (31f) am tired of being my husband's (33m) maid, his messiness is attracting unwanted attention",r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8870223,1682534963,0,1682534976,1682534977,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,16,906

My (19f) boyfriend (20m) and I have only been together for 7 months but we’ve been friends for much much longer. Back then whenever he’d get upset or something bad happened in his life, I’d always be there to comfort if he needed but every time he would set a boundary which i respected, i never pushed him i just always offered my support incase he changed his mind and wanted to talk, I understood if he didn’t want to share things because we were only friends, and I chalked it up to him just being a private person.

Well this is the first time during our relationship that he’s gone through a hard time and as usual I offered my support, but this time I expected him to lean on me, I’m his girlfriend and I should be his support system, and it’s not like he’d talk to his family about it since they don’t get along well, but same as usual he put up a wall and doesn’t let me support him, am I not doing something right? Does he not trust me? I mean we became best friends a year before we started dating and were just friends for years before that, and i’ve been nothing but honest and caring. What do I do?

She lost her job and was laid off 2 weeks ago but is allowing it to effect everything in her life like I'm not here to help her through things. I proposed to her on Saturday and thought it was perfect timing to cheer her up and have something to look forward to, and she said yes, just to turn around less than 30 minutes later and say she she would never marry the current me and the current her shouldnt get married. 

Her problems are that 

\- She doesn't have a job and doesn't want to be a house wife like I suggested, which makes no sense   
\- She doesn't like the divison of chores, as now that she has no job I have left most chores for her to do, since she has nothing to do now?   
\- She says the chores were a problem before she lost her job but now that she doesn't have her job to distract her, she resents me for our household break down    
\- I cheated in her mind once early in our relationship by telling someone I was single when I wasn't, and even though it was over a year ago she feels like I would not be a good husband and once or twice in arguments I brought up the things I pay for when she said she felt unappreciated, and now she doesn't want me to pay for anything for her at all. 

For example, we tried to carry on as normal since right after she said she didnt want to get married I asked if she wanted to break up and she said no. We talked a little and I said I was hungry and I would go get dinner. She said she would cook something at home for herself (even though we did not have enough groceries for dinner) because she didnt have an apetite and to get something for just myself. 

I did and came back home and she was only eating rice and egg. I asked her why and she said she lost her job and she is trying to stretch her severance because the job market doesn't look good right now. I told her to stop being dramatic because she has me, and she mumbled something about being stupid under her breath. 

I asked her to speak up about how she felt and she said I'm stupid if I think it would be a good idea for her to rely on me. I don't even get what that's supposed to mean when our entire relationship if she asks for something I do it even if it messes up what I have going on at the time.

relationship_advice," I started dating this girl last year. It was supposed to be casual but since the first time we laid eyes it was extremely intense. She even said it was love at first sight. And then everything was magical like in movies.   
In the beggining of this year she started behaving weirdly. She would disappear for days and then she came back with big texts saying she was depressed and having family issues, plus she was afraid of coming out as gay to her family, said she dreamed about finally doing it to be free with me. So I stayed and supported her through all of the process.   
She had a relationship with a man before but it was awful because she definitely wasn't bi and living like that caused her a lot of pain. She told me she came out to her gay ant because of me, and also she was months in therapy talking about me and her sexuality. It looked like she really was putting into work.  
But it all became a true rollercoast, bc in less than 20 days she: Talked about her struggles, said ""I love you""  for the first time. Then she asked to come into my house, so she did. She meet my family and stayed the weekend, it was all PERFECT. 3 days later she dumped me saying she didn't feel the same anymore, that I was the right person at the wrong time. It wasn't even a dialogue, she just said ""Nothing you do is going to change my mind, byeeee"" in this very ungrateful way... 5 days later she started posting nonstopping on her twitter about how she's never been so happy in life, how everything was amazing and... that she was deeply in love. She used to be very low profile and now she's online all the time talking about how perfect this new love is, **that I just found out to be a MAN.**  
God, my head is in a whirl because I can't understand anything!!! We worked so hard so she could be herself, so we could finally be together and she does that? WHAT?? I loved her so much, I cared for her with all my heart to just be discarded like I meant nothing.    
I'm so confused because, in my head, it can only be one of those two things: Or she's the biggest manipulative liar on the entire planet or she's in a serious mental breakdown. Either way she's going to suffer a lot and I kinda still feel bad for her. I feel like she took the easy way out because that way she doesn't have to come out to her family, and she won't suffer for our breakup because she's already with someone else...

relationship_advice,"I (18 M) and my girlfriend (19 F) broke up after a year and 2 months of being together and it’s killing me.

I just got out of a very serious relationship that I realized I was being progressively more toxic in.. 
she did everything she could to make me feel better, validate my feelings, listen, support.. and what did I do?

When we first got together we knew communication was going to be a problem, but it ended up being our strongest asset. We just.. believed different things, realized we weren’t ready to be together.

Everything she wanted to do bugged me. Watch social justice rants on YouTube for an hour after she got home to decompress from her day. 
Wanting to go out with a friend who I didn’t know.. and wasn’t taking initiative to know.
Decorating her apartment in ways I didn’t want for my future. We were planning to move in during July.
Being spontaneously proactive about very specific things in her life and then dropping them after a week claiming she felt “dissociative” doing them without being able to clearly tell me what that means to her.

I could go on and on but now that I’ve looked at it.. she made time for me, she was willing to not hang out with her friend for me, she was willing to compromise on decoration, she wouldn’t talk about her rabbit holes of content she’d consume even if they meant something to her..

She did everything she could for me and it didn’t matter to me because.. somehow in the back of my head it felt forced. Like it wasn’t who she was.

I don’t know the introspective methods to tell if I have toxic behavior but after reading some popular posts on here, I’m beginning to realize I do..

How do I even begin to work on that? 

I want to be able to love her for who she is even if I don’t understand why she does some things.. why she likes some things..

I want to be able to work on things with her and do things together.

I want to travel and live with her whether it’s a boring day at home or a 2 hour moment where our time off aligns..

But now it’s over, and I need to accept that. Right? 
So how do I mitigate this.. obsessive heartbreak I feel? We agreed to not talk for a while.. we want to follow up in a month.

I want to have the capacity to change and love and.. I don’t know why I don’t. I go to therapy but all they tell me about is cognitive distortions and personal ethicacy, not my behavior towards others.. 

Maybe it’s a start to respect who I am but I do. I think..? I don’t really know what that entails either.

Anyway. I miss her so bad. And I want to see her grow and be the person she is. I want to be involved in that and support her through her changes.. I want to love her..

I’ve had issues with feeling heard or wanted.. effectively all my life. And she’s had issues expressing herself all her life.. are we just not meant to be? Are there changes either of us can make..?

It’s over.. it has to be. Right? This isn’t going to kick back in the next 4 years when we realize we needed each other in different ways all along? 

I don’t know anymore. I just want to make it work.. I don’t want to be trapped with someone I don’t want to be with but she’s different.. it’s this addictive pull that I can’t describe to any extent but I can’t stop being a horrible person to her.. how do I dissolve this behavior?

When (or even if) I do is it safe to tell her? Is it fair to her?

relationship_advice,"Disclosure: this is a post I also made on the vegan subreddit.

Hello everyone! Thank you for taking the time to read this post.

I am in a relationship with my partner of over 3 years. We are both recent college grads who have been doing long distance since we graduated in May of 2022. We have recently been discussing moving in together (I would move in with her since her location is much more desirable for both of us) and all of the logistics and ""next steps"" questions that come with that. 

The biggest of these next step questions is the difference in diet between me and my partner. I have been vegan for over 5 years (before I even met my partner). My partner is Asian American, and her family eats meat, albeit less than the standard American diet (and she also has a much bigger appreciation for vegetables). When we met, I don't believe that she had ever really put much thought into veganism or other ethic-conscious diets, but she wasn't anywhere close to hostile to it. Eventually we started dating, and obviously she learned more about my perspective and vice versa. She went pescatarian about a year ago, which she is now. 

In discussing our future together, this difference has become a bit more of a point of concern. I said that ideally, a long-term partner of mine would be vegetarian at a minimum. She said that she already misses the other types of animal products she's given up, and that she's sure it'll be the same for seafood if she were to go vegetarian. This obviously makes me sad to hear, and it is kind of hard for me to empathize since my transition was pretty quick once I heard the logic behind vegetarianism and then veganism.

My thoughts/questions on this are as follows:

1. I feel stuck between the ideals of wanting a partner who I can consider reaching a certain moral standard I am comfortable with and also wanting to accept someone for who they are. 

2. Do I love her/what she could be, or do I love her as she is? I guess it's kinda the balance of unconditional love vs having hard boundaries. If we are all imperfect, is it fair of me to not want to be with you for not currently being willing to go vegetarian? But if I care about animal rights, is it right for me to be with someone who eats them? I want to accept someone who I see as a long term partner for what they are, not what they may become. And I'm also thinking of the reverse situation, where if I was with someone who is vegan, and they decided to stop. Would I break up with them? Is that right?

3. I obviously care about my partner, and in every other way I can see myself being with them long term. Plus, does it even make sense to potentially limit the people I can date to like 5% of the population? This also triggers larger frustrations with society at large.

4. A part of me is like, how can someone be exposed to the arguments around veganism for so long (3+ years) and not become one? Again, this is my frustration since my change was relatively quick.

5. Does/should this logic carry over to friends and family as well?

She used to send me semi nudes and we both enjoyed it. We never had video sex but she told me that we’ll have video sex after we will meet. I’m going to meet her for 1st time in next month. She is excited for love making but sometimes she says that she doesn’t want sex and just want to make love, real love which connects soul. But sometimes she says that she wants to have sex with me to make our bond tighter. Few days we were horny and were about to sext but then i asked her for video sex and she said no it’s not good. Then I asked her if she has tried it before. She said yes but my question made her upset because she don’t want to remember her past. Then she told me that she used to have video sex with her ex but soon it lost its essence. She didn’t get a chance to have sex with her ex due to lost feelings after video sex. She told me that she doesn’t want same thing to happen between us that’s why she was avoiding video sex and sending nudes and also told me that we’ve already discussed that we’ll have video sex after meeting then why am I asking same thing again and again. We didn’t had sexting that day. After 2-3 says we fought and arguments have became frequent from last 2 months due to my behaviour. I’m afraid she’ll lose feelings for me and unlove me because she’s hell irritated with daily fights and she told me that she wished she haven’t fallen in love with me and we were good as best friends. I want everything to be back to normal as it was and when we meet i want her to feel for me romantically and sexually. I want to make love with her and eventually have sex to make our bond stronger.

We had on and off crushes on each other the whole time, and we finally got together the beginning of our senior year of high school.

However, she started seeing a guy who is currently seeing/dating someone else and is a known serial cheater (she told me this months back).

relationship_advice,"32(m) with 32(f) we have a 5yo girl together.
I met this girl while I was in a depressed situation. I was in a 5 year relationship with someone 4 years younger than me. I was out working and she was going to school and partying. I was never into party's so we drifted. In that relationship I made a few mistakes,talking to and seeking out other women. I never slept with anyone else, but did talk to girls inappropriately a few times.
Fast forward to the last 3 month of that relationship, we moved in together and it just made things more and more stressful until I broke it off. Admittedly I had met my, now gf, about 1 month before we broke it off.

After about 3 months I started dating and sleeping with this new girl who had previously been in a very abusive relationship. We talked
about how I basically, actually, saved her life. She wanted to have a child and I was open to it so we very quickly found out she was
pregnant after being together for about 6 months.

Now we had fought over stupid stuff and I felt like it was just getting used to things and overcoming her, what I believe to be, ptsd. So
we fought and broke up and then talked it out and got together. We lived together an in apartment for 6 months, then at my parents
house for 6 months between the lease and buying a home.
Once we had the 3 of us together things just quickly became overwhelming. Between depression, new child, and stress, the fights just
came back. Insecurities about who I was talking to at work, who I was talking to on my phone, why wasn't I posting about her on my fb
(I don't post anything except happy birthday to friends from highschool and statuses promoting my business) she feels very ""invisible""
in my public life.
I don't hang out with anyone, I only spend time working or with my family. I did a few times specifically try to have people over and it all
just fell through.
Now 5 years into life with a child together, 6 or so years of knowing and being with each other, I find that every single thing that happens
seems to have a string attached to me.
For instance, I am a personable person that thrives on interactions, being nice, and helpful. I quickly build relationships with people.
I have a couple of older women 40-50 that are married and have kids. I spoke with them briefly about the troubles I've had. I always
asked if I was over reacting or being too much one way or another. We talked a few things out and they said their piece. Admittedly I've
had similar conversations with my mother and my sister.

Well my gf met the ladies and now feels like I've made them dislike her even before meeting them. I responded that some people will
like her and some people won't. These ladies are medical workers and we see them twice a year for appointments.
As soon as I told her that she felt like I didn't care about her feelings, I didn't comfort her, I didn't do anything she said.
This is how nearly everything goes, i give her no social media recognition, I poison relationships because I ask people for advice, im
not supporting her etc.

So now I'm asking the internet, and if she knew she would probably be passed off. But I am truly looking to see if there is something
wrong with me because I constantly feel like there's one turning point waiting. Like a light switch will flip and a realization will occur
and everything will fulfill its potential. Is this situation worth or able to be salvaged, thoughts and advice. Or how should I proceed if
not?

relationship_advice,"We (F&amp;M 23) have been together for 3 yrs now. I suffer of depressive episodes of different intensities. Last time I had one this bad was about 2y ago, so already having gone through one I know what to expect this time. It's been going on for 2 and a half months now. 

About 1 month in, I sat down with my BF and told him what's going on. I talked to him about how the symptoms manifest, lack of motivation, having no interest in things I used to love, nonexistent libido etc. I told him what he could do to help (what i thought would help, I'm not that well educated on this), things like checking in on me(specifically to ask how I've been, this is so it'd be easier for me to open up) and trying to get me out of the house. I also warned him that this period will last a while. At the time I felt like he actually listened.

Two weeks had passed since we had that discussion and one day I went over at his house to watch a movie and afterwards he tried to initiate sex. I told him I'd prefer we stick to making out and then he asked ""are you sure? we haven't done it in a while"" which is true, we haven't, but he knew the reason why. I told him I felt ashamed for telling him no and also kind of embarrased, but that the situation I made him aware of 2 weeks prior hasn't changed. He then proceeded to ask me how I've been feeling and that was the moment I realised that he hadn't actually checked up on me since the discussion, which left me a bit heartbroken.

His attitude towards this makes me feel very lonely. It's always been difficult for me to open up to someone, and having done that took a lot of effort. I wish it would've helped, but right now I feel like it didn't. It's like we never talked about it, like it never happened. How should I go about this? Should I have another talk with him? Thank you for taking the time to read this, I'd appreciate any advice.

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I have been together about a year today, but not really. In the beginning of our relationship my bf did a lot of terrible things (emotionally cheating with an ex, lying, gaslighting and invalidation) that left me in crippling trauma and anxiety for about 6 months before we rebuilt trust and moved on. I have for the most part suppressed and dealt with my feelings and triggers when they have arisen, and I do go to therapy semiregularly. 

Last night, my bf was reading me stories to me on facetime to help me fall asleep, because I had really bad anxiety about an upcoming exam. The story he was reading was about a man's ""first love"", and given that it is basically our 1 year anniversary of our first date... I was thinking about how sad I was that I could never tell anyone that I was chosen, respected, and loved from the beginning in the way the man loved his person from the beginning. I expressed to my bf that I was hurt, that I felt so sad and betrayed that I could never have that. He told me to go to sleep and not think about it, so ""I wouldn't be stressed"".  I am not the type that can do that.. anxiety doesn't just disappear when I will it to. I assume he didn't want me bringing it up and that's why he was quick to dismiss me. I barely slept and when I did I had horrible nightmares about him cheating in front of me, and laughing at me crying. I woke up in tears twice. 

This morning we got into an argument, because I was feeling completely betrayed and dismissed from the previous night. He told me several things that have genuinely shattered my heart. 

1. ""Now I want to avoid the topic or stories in general because god forbid something is mentioned that reminds you of a bad time.""
2.  ""Why does it matter if I've loved you purely from the beginning or not?""
3. ""I'm here now, the present, loving you purely, things happen and I'm sorry for what I did but this is reality now. Can you not accept this?""
4. ""I just want to know why its (loving me from the beginning and being chosen from the beginning) is so important. Sure it would be nice, poetic even, but life isn't a fairytale""
5. ""despite what you may think I love you and I'm here for you.""

I feel completely unloved, and like my pain and trauma that he caused me is not validated or understood. He dents seem to have any remorse for what he did or any empathy for how it might make me feel. He doesn't even understand why it is so heartbreaking that he did these things to me. Everything he says feels cruel and hurtful, and like a slap in the face.

relationship_advice,"Hello! I've been seeing this person for two months now. I thought things were going well but we had a very awkward date last night. He seemed distant and didn't initiate any physical contact (which is unusual)

I've been sleeping over at his place 1-2x a week and it's always him asking. Because of this, I have my toothbrush and soap in his bathroom. 

Last night I forgot my phone at his place so I asked him to drop it off in the morning.... Along with my toothbrush and soap. It's bad but I wanted him to ask me why I wanted those things back but he made no comment and just said ok. 

This morning, he handed me the stuff and my phone. He said have a good day and left. We didn't kiss goodbye either.

relationship_advice,"I understood it's a normal human thing but in my head I see it as a bad thing especially in this context.
So my boyfriend texted in like a discord server in general about how he almost got his car robbed. While he was telling this in the server I saw that he called someone a nickname ""pookie bear"" a cute little nickname. We used to mess around and he would call me that sometimes but seeing him call someone else that I feel jealous but I feel like it's wrong because at the time his just telling how he just got robbed. Almost feels like I'm more worried about him calling someone else ""pookie bear"" than on how he almost got robbed and I understand that sounds bad especially since I feel more jealous than worried about him. Don't get me wrong I do still am worried but feeling jealous is just not letting me think of something else.
Am I wrong for feeling jealous ? Am I been controlling how do I even talk about this to him im scared I don't want him to know about this but I feel guilty because im trying to be open to them as best as possible?

relationship_advice,I guess this is more so me advice rather than relationship advice but it applies to this current one im in. Sorry if this is super general advice but I cant find much good advice online about this topic. I consider myself a pretty sociable person but when it comes to women I dont often find myself in relationships. Probably due mainly to my appearance but Ive been in a couple of relationships in my younger years but last one was when I was about 18-19. I never really had any hook ups or have girls casually flirting with me like that and have always been in pretty intense relationships. This is translating pretty poorly into my adult life now because when I do meet a girl I catch feelings very quickly since I rarely find girls that are interested in me. Its starting to affect my relationship with her since shes been taking things more slowly obviously since we are so far away and I dont want to ruin things with her since I like her a lot.

The relationship was almost 2 years full of date nights, vacations, and everything a couple would do. We haven’t been together since the beginning of the year which was also the last time we were intimate while “not being together . When I ask what we are doing  she says “let’s focus on being friends again, just vibe”. 

From then till now she has experienced her grandfather passing away, having to move out of her home, studying for a medical school entrance exam, and my constantly calling her phone has gotten her written up at work. On top of this she is struggling financially, even though she works more than me, i do help her out as much as i can which leaves me in a struggle some weeks. 

Whenever she needs help i go out the way to help her, if she needs money i send what i can but when i ask to talk she says “im overwhelmed and overstimulated” on-top of having to deal with the other things i listed above 

She says dont wait for her, but for some reason I am. I talk to other girls and even been on dates but i cant get over her.",0,M25 F24 : we broke up but still talk basically everyday and I’m having the hardest time letting go,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8870007,1682532892,0,1682532908,1682532909,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,19,202

After that we connected our whole lives together, we started a pop up toy business, I took on a step mother role to his daughters, (we moved in together about a month and a half before her birth). Now I’m January he takes on a contract job outta state, how this was approached was he’d be flying back and fourth and should be primarily home, but instead he’s home about 4 -6 days of the month at this time, since then iv ran our business completely alone (1 to 2 days of work a week before inventory and other aspect that have to be handled), take care of his toddler daughter on the weekends, moved all our personal and business stuff out the house (and am expected to move all the stuff in on my own as well), and have had to care for the cars, all completely alone while working full time since he’s outta state trying to make money, yesterday I learned his car was towed from his sisters apartment complex a couple days ago, I didn’t realize in between the traveling outta town, running two markets and working my regular job this weekend, now I’m being yelled at and belittled and told it’s my fault and my responsibilities, that if I’m not gonna help him as his girlfriend then I can GTFO, and all this other stuff, every time he flies home I’m told how I’m failing to do anything right, he’s constantly telling me that I can get out of his families house, and just always making me feel like a failure and I know it’s just “girl leave” but after losing a baby and being in the middle of trying to have one (add that I’m a high risk pregnancy and almost thirty so really who would want to deal with that), I just feel so lost and torn, I just wanted to create a happy family and business, I don’t understand why what I do is never enough and where to even go from here, I know this is unhealthy but I feel frozen.

relationship_advice,"My(26F) bf (32M) is a good man. He's helpful and incredibly kind to me. He's been there for me when the depression got so bad that I needed him. Otherwise, I try to hide it. 

Normally I'm okay. But with PMDD (diagnosed 2 years ago), I become mentally unwell just before and during some periods. I can manage it myself sometimes through meditation and mindfulness. However, this period in particular has been the worst in a while. 

I binge drank last night and skipped classes today. After crying a lot and working through my feelings, I do feel better. I feel ashamed for my irresponsible actions last night and today and have done some reflection. 

I don't tend to lie, and I've never cheated on anyone. However, I think I want to lie about skipping classes today. Part of it is shame, and part of it is me not wanting to burden him with my sensitivities. If I tell him I skipped, I'll have to revisit how I was feeling, and i might cry, make the night about me, etc. I dont want to burden him. This is my fight, and I'm winning. I just lost today.

relationship_advice,"My (f22) boyfriend (m22) is a drug addict and this combined with the lying and a few other things causes a lot of arguments between us. We both have mental health issues, and it’s so hard for me to keep my cool sometimes. I know I say things I shouldn’t sometimes. I know I’m passive aggressive and take shots at him or put him down sometimes. However, I refuse to believe I’m the problem in this relationship. 

He owes me thousands, he has lied to me over our entire relationship (prob about a year and a half long, we were really close friends a few months longer as well), he has stolen from me, I’ve bailed him out with money so many times so he wouldn’t go homeless and once so he wouldn’t go to jail. 

It feels like I’m not allowed to be upset or hurt by this or anything he continues to do. It feels like I’m not allowed to react authentically. He gets upset I don’t trust him, but why should I? He makes promises just to break them. Not once has he shown me he can be fully honest and upfront. Then when we argue if I speak my mind, then HE can’t say anything because he’s “just a piece of shit, drug addict, failure.”

at a restaurant. We started on about April 5th and since then I'm stressed af. He was complaining that I don't give him much attention and that I'm always ""in my own world"" and stuff. We talked about it and I told him he needs to understand and support me, that it is only the beginning and he knows it bc we know each other before we got together. After we talked he just changed a little but l've reached a point that I don't even want to talk to him. Whenever he talks he makes
me angry no matter what he says. Am I crazy? Can I do something for that? What should I tell him to make him understand? I'm even considering breaking up I can't

relationship_advice,"I don’t really know if this is the right sub to talk about this but I really want some advice on what to do in my situation

I’m 19f and hes 22m, we’ve known each other for a year+ but we started dating officially this new years till april 25. We were long distance and would meet twice a month less or more. 

He had done something before we started dating with another girl which had rlly fcked me up and i tried to break up with him multiple times cause of it, it wasn’t anything physical just rlly fcked me up emotionally for so long as he technically ghosted and emotionally cheated on me for another girl. Because hed always talk about being loyal in the talking stage but couldn’t do that himself. I know nothing happened between them but i kept thinking I was the second option, i assumed he probably liked her as when he came back from ghosting me he would call her every night ignoring me sometimes despite the distress he put me through. He also ended the talking stage multiple times throughout the year over small issues but would always come back and i let him back. 

But as of recently he started getting really busy with work, moving out and i guess he has a lot on his plate. And i thought we were doing fine, even though we had a lot of arguments throughout our relationship and i tried to break up with him a LOT of times, and hed just beg me to stay and i stayed every single time. I didnt even want to break up with him it was just my lack of maturity and wanting him to understand my pain and reassure me. It definitely wasnt the right way to go about getting reassurance and i realized that a little late. 

but during the months of Dec-April he treated me well always reassuring me but during the start of april he kept telling me he couldnt prioritize me as much due to his work and i communicated a lot with him about how i felt and he kept telling me the same thing he was busy with getting his life together. And so am i but i still made so much time for him. 

Getting to the main problem. We had a talk at night and everything was okayish and in the morning we called to talk abt our problems again just not as in detail and he promised to talk about our issues in depth in the evening when he was free because he kept complaining how busy he was going to be. So i decided to be patient and just wait till the night. But around 5 i just felt like checking up on him by texting him hi and i checked his location to see he was at the mall. I was so upset over this to see him say that he was so busy with work but he was at the mall?? and I just went off on him and decided to break up with him through text i was at a place with my friend cause she knew how down i was about this whole relationship not going the way i wanted it too.  And we ended up saying some hurtful things to him through text such as “i will never forgive you”. I didnt really want to say all of that but i was upset let my friend also say rlly hurtful things too cause i was so upset and didnt care because he hurt me a lot in the past. He saw these messages and replied he just went to get a water bottle. And then thats when i knew i fucked up bad.

Later that night i apologized to him and we were talking about what to do, like going no contact etc. I couldnt stop crying. I had been crying the entire week. He was a really good bf to me and I love him with all my heart but I messed up really bad. He did too and i gave him shit for it for the longest with the constsnt arguments, name calling and jus not being able to love him fully without being scared he was going to do the same if another girl came into his life. he didn’t deserve it. He deserved forgiveness from me. But i was jus so stupid i dont know why i did what i did i just felt it was right in the moment. And during this call at night I ended up asking for another chance i was on the verge of begging for it and he told me “I’m not sure what to do or say”, “ I don’t want to make you wait for an answer as its not fair to you”. Just stuff similar like that. And that he probably wouldn’t believe that i truly want to be in the relationship because ill always have that one thing he did in the back of my mind. He then asked for space for the night but he hasn’t responded to any of my texts since the morning. 

I really want my love back, I don’t know how to go about this situation. I texted him in the morning about going no contact because i felt he wasnt invested in the relationship anymore but literally 3 hours later i texted him again asking if hes sure about all of this even though he didnt respond to my first one. I know im being desperate but it really hurts. hes my first love, first kiss, first everything and i just want him back and make it right. 

Please dont be mean about me begging for another chance, i dont regret it and i know i shouldn’t have to beg for someones love. But i wanted him to know how much it hurts me to go through with this.",0,"I 19f broke up with my bf(22m) really regret it and want him back, but now he is unsure",r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8869829,1682531158,0,1682531170,1682531170,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,19,999

relationship_advice,"recently my gf and I mutually broke up, then when we moved into separate living spaces I asked her out on a date and we dated for a bit before I broke up with her again, then we started dating a 2nd time before she decided to break up with me. Now finally she wants to get back together and jump in with both feet.

On paper we have similar interest and the same core values about nearly every aspect of our life. 
However even though I am trying to jump in with both feet like she said she would I am really struggling to say I love her. I am in turmoil because of it and don't know why I am struggling so bad.
I feel like after she broke up with me that last time I truly accepted it and started moving on, now jumping back in seems so difficult and feels like the wrong move even though we have so many good traits as a couple.

relationship_advice,"I’m really at a point where I don’t even know if I’m capable of leaving. My mind has been so broken down by the abuse that I can’t even think straight. He’s psychologically and sexually abused me and still I’m literally addicted to him.

People in the comments are going to tell me to block him and get some self respect but I don’t even think it’s about that at this point. I held my ground while he was harassing me but once it stopped I panicked and went back. I literally blocked him and then drove to his house that same evening. He doesn’t even have to come get me anymore, I just go to him.

Him and I came to the conclusion that I sublease my apartment and move back home so I can do things correctly this time in terms of “moving for love”. I’m scared that this is part of his plan though to exploit me later by either getting us to live together so he has more control over me or whatever ulterior motive he has. But I just know that even though me moving away is a good idea for me, he has other ideas.

I feel a total lack of control over my life. It feels like he’s making all the decisions. He says things like I probably wouldn’t last as long as I did in my career without him helping me and talks about how much I admire him. It just makes me feel like I’m dependent on him.

relationship_advice,"My now fiancé  has what I would consider “micro-cheated” twice in our 7 year relationship…

The first incident was about 5 years ago with a high school class mate, it was mainly Instagram DMs commenting on her pictures, more specifically about her body. I don’t remember much of the text but it was hurtful to see him talk about another woman like that while we were dating.

2 years ago we went through another situation of flirtatious texts sent to his female coworker (also around our same age). There were texts and  Instagram DMs this time not about her body but just flirtatious messages /non- work related conversations/sending memes. 

I addressed both situations almost immediately as I felt very hurt and disrespected. He keeps assuring me I have nothing to worry about and I was misinterpreting the situation. Yet, anytime it comes up he admits to “fucking up” and says it’ll never happen again. 

With his coworker, he insists they are just friends and wants me to meet her because he thinks we’ll get along- but I have no desire to meet her given the situation. 

He was offered to go on a business trip to Europe a few months back, I was immediately interested in tagging along as it’s near a city I have always wanted to go to. He said to wait booking my trip as his details needed to be confirmed. I waited but he ended up telling me he thought it was best to sit it out to save money and because he wouldn’t have a lot of down time to explore the surrounding cities together (Paris/Switzerland/Milan).

He then tells me that this coworker is joining. I tried to look at their messages prior to the trip but everything had been deleted (iMessage and instagram DMs that used to be there). 

He is there with her now and I feel sick thinking about it, and now he has mentioned that she wants to go to Paris on their days off together.

I feel so sad and angry by how these last few months have played out, I feel like I could have/should have gone with on the trip.

We both deleted our dating apps &amp; became exclusive after a few dates. The only thing that makes things hard is that he lives in a (very nice, custom built) camper attached to his truck. He is very successful in his career. Makes 6 figures, but lives this way by choice because he trains for ultramarathons &amp; runs in hills/mountains for hours and says living this way is easier for him. I really like him. Despite his busy life, he makes time for me and drives an hour to see me every weekend. He seems to be really into me. I’ve met a bunch of his friends and he’s told his family about me.

On the other hand, my friends and family say I am making a mistake. They say I’m basically dating a homeless guy and that we will never have a future together. I won’t lie, sometimes I get concerned about the future too, but I worry if it’s too soon to bring it up with him? We reference the future by saying things we will do together and make jokes about our “future children” but we’ve never really had a serious talk about it. Is it too soon? Are my friends and family right?

relationship_advice,"I (27M NL) met this girl (25F USA) on RuneScape (OSRS) last December. Let’s call her a Hero, that turned into a villain. We were fishing (we spoke months before about UX research) and she asked multiple times if anyone had a “pike” and could show how big it was. I jokingly said that I have one, we started chatting on multiple apps and did FT calls for hours a day from the very start. She said it’s easy and feels good to talk to me. We have so much in common. She started sending me spicy pics/videos since the first day, she clearly already had experience with that.

Within the first month, we checked our compatibility of love languages, it was all “good” according to her. A month after we met, she told her parents she would visit me, (after avoiding them for days) but didn’t mention that we are in a relationship. They started panicking and tried to talk her out of the situation multiple times. Her mom insisted to get a ticket she could cancel. They told her grandmother a lie about how we met. Things went downhill very slowly after her parents knew about us, my mood was constantly affected by their high pressure and challenges. Every time things got hard; we would tell each other: “we’ll be fine”.

Hero said her mom asked a friend (Bob) that works for the Finnish FBI, to do a background check on me. He thought I was a “human trafficker”, based on what her mom said. He did the check and couldn’t find anything (suspicious) at all. Her mom thought this was a red flag. Her mom called me a “loverboy”, for sending flowers, chocolates, and a teddy bear for Valentine’s Day. I even got called “serial killer”, all behind my back. My ex-gf thought I would run away after all this, I didn’t, yet I wanted twice. 

I had to give her parents the address we would stay at and my mom’s address too. I also send my ID card and my OSRS name. She sent (family) pictures of me to her parents, but it didn’t help much. Her mom even threatened with: “Luckily I have a few contacts in Amsterdam!” while she doesn’t. 

Three weeks before she visited, my ESTA got approved within an hour. When I wanted to share it with her parents, she said to not do that yet. 

She goes for walks at a graveyard every week, to read the names on the gravestones and doesn’t have any real friends. She calls her mom her friend but accuses her of being a bad person and mentally abusing her since birth. She said her dad wasn’t there for her at the start. Her parents were never married and separated before she was born. Her dad found a partner like 3 years ago and married her within 8 months. Hero has 2 stepsisters but doesn’t talk to them, as she holds grudge against her dad for marrying another woman.

She had been on missionary training in Australia, Mexico and Turkey and blames her father for sending her. She doesn’t want to talk about it, as it gave her traumas. She also blames her father a lot for not having her “h\*e phase” during her college years. When she had s\*x after the training, it made her more addicted she said. She felt missed out and she wants it anytime and anywhere now. Before we got exclusive, she said she still wants to have this “h\*e phase” and try so many things with other people. Sometimes even during normal FaceTime conversations she would play with herself. She even got wet over games of online chess with me. She’d been to therapy before, but only said: “because of things of the past”.

She told me about some of the naughty stuff she did. She got caught sneaking out late at nights to meet boys when she was just 13 for s\*x. The random places, all the problems she got into because of her s\*xual misbehaving everywhere. She mentioned proudly how she had a lot of boyfriends. She spoke about dating many guys and always watch what they tipped, and still waxing her private parts once a month while taking drugs to not feel the pain. She asked me why guys didn’t want to go down on her. She told me she could be my personal wh\*re, b\*tch and sl\*t. 

Once she’d send me two album pictures where she still had long hair. One where she did a perfect “Playboy bunny” sign with her fingers, when I asked about it twice, she made up that she tried to do a “peace” sign. One of FaceTime where she was naked behind her laptop with hearts above her head.

We agreed to not push, rush, or put pressure on things and that we would always communicate if we wanted less or more of something. We said we would learn together, grow together, and find the balance between us. We also did a pinky promise and said: “for a long time, not a short time.” We promised to fight for what we have and make it work. I told her the distance isn’t an issue, I could visit monthly or give her tickets.

I taught her a lot of Dutch as she wanted that. She told me she tried to learn 3 other languages before but couldn’t tell me why. She shared some Dutch songs with me, they were all trashy club songs. We spoke about closing the gap next year, after she is done with her Master’s. She said she wants to get rid of her two last names, use her second name (and/or mine) as last and leave the USA for good with her two cats. She made secret Pinterest boards called “Marriage”, “Home”, “Recipes” and “Travel” for us. She made me a Spotify playlist called “Songs that make me think of you❤️” for Valentine’s Day with songs as: “Billianne – Simply the best” and “Avery Lynch – all I need (the distance song)”, hours after my gifts. The duration was 1:28 hours, the angel number she and her dad kept seeing before we met. A week after she went back to the USA, I made her a playlist, but she didn’t join.

When we planned her visit, we promised each other that a second visit was a must. She promised me she wouldn’t ghost me or whatsoever after visiting, because: “that would be very cruel, and we would be totally fine”. I took the HPV vaccination. She changed her mind about birth control pills and lied it takes months to get it in Michigan. We agreed that I would take my first Covid shot (the shot gave me complications with my heart) after she leaves, so I can visit at the end of April when her semester ends. We planned to celebrate King’s Day in Holland, Michigan. Multiple times I tried to book the trip and she told me twice to just do it. I couldn’t and she knew, because she doesn’t know when her internship starts and what time duration will be ok for her. I asked her to think about it, but eventually she said we would plan the second visit while she’s here. Just before she got here, she would get random calls during our FT calls, she lied it was telemarketers. We didn’t plan my visit that week because she was avoiding it. When she was here, she didn’t want to talk about her last day, “so we could both live in the moment”. She told me multiple times before and after the visit that she had no reservations.

She told me multiple times (before and during the visit) she would come back and to not go see every tourist attraction. She even spoke about joining them to the Red Rocks Amphitheatre this summer and meet her parents, if I visit for a long time in April. She said I remind her of her dad, in good ways. I asked her to join me and my siblings to The Weeknd in June. Her parents even asked me several times to meet them soon after their daughter returns, but she told me (before, during and after her visit) she didn’t want to answer them and that I shouldn’t either. Her mom even gifted me socks from her hometown, and I gifted her family some souvenirs. They called me a gentleman and thanked me for taking care so well of their daughter, keeping her happy and safe.

Her mom tried to make her dad join the visit. The night before her flight to me, her mom gave us both a really hard time again. I could tell Hero was totally done with that behavior, and she projected it onto me. It all made me exhausted, sad, and stressed again.

After two months of talking, she got on a plane during Spring break (Mo-Sa) and watched The Princess Diaries. We had 5 amazing days together, according to both of us. Her parents wanted to call with her every day, and I send pictures (she insisted no PDA) in the group chat to proof she was ok. We both shared our location 24/7 so they would know where we were. She said multiple times she felt so lucky and asked many times: “who made you?” as she was impressed how well I treated her overall. I said we can meet my mom, but she said only if I (27M) am comfortable with it, or we can save that for the next time she visits or when she is back home, we all can FaceTime. She even told me about her neighbors, so I would know who they are when I visit. 

When she was here, she declared her love and feelings for me again and said many words of affirmation. During the late Valentine’s Day dinner on the 3rd day, she seemed a bit off. She said she didn’t take her meds that day, but she can’t afford to not take her meds, she has only one kidney. She used that excuse if something was wrong. Eventually she said she’s also not used to things like this. I saw she was uncomfortable. The day after she randomly mentioned OnlyFans very passionately. Her mom asked if we were planning when I’ll visit, but Hero ignored her. On Friday she mentioned twice in a row that her boyfriend is black, but my skin tone is olive. That day we went to two restaurants, she wanted to go to a club after, but I didn’t want to. We still had many things to talk about. I felt like a tour guide at one point, we visited many places and didn’t take any proper quiet time together. 

The night before she went back, she said that we don’t have to get heavily emotional, as we’ll see each other in 1.5 month, while I was emotional. At the airport she cried and said again that we’ll see each other in 1.5 month, and time flies when we communicate.

She went back to the USA and texted she missed me the moment she walked through the gates and couldn’t wait to see and hold me again. I shared my location, so she would always know where I am. She didn’t share hers with me. She said that there were no big red flags during the visit.

She ignored me for a big part the first 2 days. After that they all got covid. I gave her the space and time to get better and I asked them I could help with anything. She wasn’t very talkative. I asked if she wanted to call to explain to me what I did wrong. She said I didn’t do anything wrong, but I can read her emotions, even by text. She said she was acclimating, then started processing everything. We promised each other beforehand we wouldn’t do this that hard. She has anxiety and this behavior of overthinking everything in private.

The calls always started with a smile, but after the visit she looked mad, stressed, and annoyed. One week after the visit she said she’s behind with college, calling for several hours a day the past 2 months wasn’t good (250+ hours), that she is in grad school and said that the pet names I use are too much for her: “She isn’t used to that at all as her parents never showed her that kind of love.” I felt a breakup coming up, but she assured me not.   
I always told her that her happiness is important to me, her college and hobbies are a priority and that I would still be here to chat with her. I always gave her the space and time to finish her college work. I saw her change to a happy and strong girl, compared to our first call. We both brought out the best out of each other. We never had a fight and never gave each other the silent treatment. She said several times: “If only you knew how much you mean to me and how happy you make me.” 

We called again on my request after a couple days and she said our love languages are not the same, we might not be compatible, that it would be unfair to me if we stay together and that I deserve better. She is really fixated by that, but never communicated with me her concerns. A week after her return, she would often ignore my messages or give me short, vague replies. We haven’t talked properly since she went back to the USA, she slowly and silently distanced herself. Yet she kept giving me hope by mentioning that she applied to more internships and telling me about next semester classes.

I said I’m working on myself and that I want to love her in her love language, but she didn’t care, and compared us to her past relationships. She said she must think about it all. She mentioned that her parents said to only book one trip and see what happens after. She had a secret agenda and was manipulating me. If I knew this before, I wouldn’t let her visit.

She mostly ghosted/mentally tortured me for 3 full weeks, I think she also took this long to see if she was pregnant or not. She mentioned during our last call that she values her independence, and that something had been brewing before her visit.

She has another account on OSRS she hid from me. She is part of social Discord channels and is secretive about who she has as friends there and on OSRS. She got items and membership from these guys, but for what in exchange? She said she made Discord a year ago for college, but the account is new based on the date. She even put a red hexagon in her bio after meeting me. She made Discord on October 5th 2022, and disabled it on April 5th 2023, exactly 6 months apart.

Her past relationships weren’t great. The last one lasted 3 years (mostly LDR) and she met the guy on Tinder. He used to handcuff her, he never cared about her needs and never made her finish. When she was here, she told me several times she loved me, felt so save and never had something like this before. She said I could put a promise ring on her finger if I wanted to.

One week after her visit, she told me she only said: “I love you” and “I miss you” just to please me and that we go too fast. I have a feeling she never stopped using her Tinder account as she’s not receiving messages (phone on airplane mode) on Saturday evening (second in a row) nor responding till she goes to bed very late at night on the weekends. She ignored questions about this or gave vague answers.

After 2 weeks of her returning, she added a “cry baby” heart tattoo on her Pinterest. She already had 2 of those before she met me. Five days after that she kicked me from/left our Pinterest boards. First “Marriage” and “Tattoos” then hours later “Home”, “Quotes” and “Recipes” and the day after “Travel”. The day after (April 1st) she blocked me on Pinterest and Spotify. On the 5th she kicked me from the shared photo album she made after her return and deactivated her Discord. I wasn’t even using Discord anymore.

The days before breakup, she been communicating on times with angel numbers that stand for: change, personal freedom, closure and moving on. She believes in that, I had to Google it as it was obvious. We know each other since December, been in a relationship for 2.5 months. I’ve always been open and honest to her and never mistreated her. We broke up on April 1st by text and didn’t call, I asked if we could stay friends and she said: “Of course”. I asked my stuff back, she said she would send it all the next day. I wondered every day for 3 weeks when the package would arrive, but it was never on its way. We didn’t talk for 18 days. On Wednesday (April 19th) she received a book: “The 5 love Languages” and a handwritten letter and card by mail from me. After she saw the package, she said that it’s better to cut off contact. She hasn’t told her parents as her semester didn’t end yet (28th of April). I can share so much more, but this post is already too long.

I am left with so many questions. I feel like she played all of us. What did I do wrong? How can someone change their mind and feelings so suddenly and drastically after all that?

relationship_advice,"I feel like my (M27) finance (F24) and I are not in the same place right now and it sucks. I love her so much so this is tough for me to write but…

Background: I work in tech from home, she is a teacher. She has crazy long days with crazy kids, is up at 5am and rightfully exhausted when she gets home, but it’s creating some problems.

I originally was going to write the title “my finance doesn’t prioritize sex” but I retitled it because I realized it’s much deeper than that.

When we first started dating she was super active, loved to work out, eat healthy, be adventurous, and have sex but now all of that has dropped to they wayside.

Literally as soon as she gets home she changes out of (what I think are attractive teacher clothes) into something that just doesn’t scream let’s have sex and sits on the couch eating and watching tv before she goes to bed at 7 to wake up and do it again the next day.

I’ve brought it up to her that I want to go to the gym with her and she says she’s down but whenever I ask it’s always a “not today” kind of answer.

We’ve talked about the lack of sex and she says that “if you want me to have more free time I can quit my job.”

A couple things have obviously changed — she was in school when we first started dating, now she’s not, we didn’t live together, and some smaller details.

I just feel like I’m at a loss because we’ve had conversations but nothing fruitful comes out of them other than “well when was the last time you tried to have sex with me and I’m like 2 nights ago but you said you had to go to bed.”

I love how hard she works at her job but it’s coming at a huge cost to our relationship and I don’t feel supported when she says the only option for her to fix that is quit her job.

relationship_advice,I’ll get right to it. I hope it’s not too long. Yesterday my girl and I didn’t really talk. I was working and so was she. She works from her home and I dont. We didn’t talk until that evening sometime. But before that I got a message from her best friend telling me that my girls niece was in the hospital. Come to find out that they were in a wreck. Her niece ended up with a minor head injury and a broken arm. My girl was ok. They were not at fault. I was shocked that it happened. So when I did talk to my girl I was a tad bothered that I found out through the best friend. I didn’t think about the things that my girl was going through at the time taking care of her niece. But I did have an attitude. Her emotions were already stressed and high. I understood. I think she could tell in my dry tone that I was upset and she asked why. Long story short it turned into an argument. All this while she was in the hospital room with her niece. Smh. She was so stressed and said to me “I’m about to cry” and I don’t even know why but my response was “I wanna get off the phone” she pleaded saying no and why I yelled back at her “please let me get of the phone” and she sadly told me ok and we got off.

relationship_advice,"I’ve known this girl for several years and she has been a good friend of mine for a long time. We’ve had a very obvious chemistry since day 1 but she was in a relationship at the time, as was I, so we never pursued anything obviously. It was just something I filed away in my head, until some time ago when my relationship ended after I was cheated on and discarded. Coincidentally, the same thing recently happened to her too, and we are both single now. Her situation is further complicated though as she has a one year old child with her ex. I have no kids.

For about a week, things have been flying. I’ve been out of my relationship since the beginning of this year, but hers only ended a few weeks ago, and I know she is still reeling from it and not ready to jump into anything new. I might not be either. But what I do know is that I REALLY, really like this person. I may have even been in love with her for a while now, and to be honest I am getting that vibe from her as well. Since we both admitted we had feelings, things just escalated. We’ve been talking about the future. She’s been asking me about kids and how I feel about hers. Our career goals. Asking each other every question we can think of. She even asks me about live languages and tries to understand my boundaries. It really feels like it’s moving in the right direction with a very like-minded person. But that scared me a little, and her too I think.

We talked about not moving so fast but I think we did anyway. There has been nothing physical yet but the texting has been all day and all night for a week now. She flirts a LOT, very sexually too, but then she will tell me that we need to slow down and be careful. Night before last, she tells me that her ex tried to come back. She turned him down and has been very clear that she will never go back to him after the cheating and abuse, and hasn’t loved him in nearly a year, but it still worried me because she became very depressed after their meeting. She said she was going to bed early, barely spoke two words to me, and the next morning she texts me first thing saying “hey”, but after I replied, I got nothing back for nearly 8 hours. 

I don’t think she’s reck suffering her ex, and I don’t think I’ve done anything to change her mind about me, however, I do think that she might be a little scared and is still trying to figure me out. I think she believes that I want sex right away but I absolutely do not and haven’t been pushing for it either. It feels more like a test, like if she pulls-away, will I be clingy? I might have been a bit up until now, but I decided to handle this by addressing it directly. 

I sent her a kind of long email where I explained that I could tell she still needs some space to work through everything, and that I wanted to give that to her and also pull back a little myself. I explained that neither of us were mentally ready for a relationship and that we should just get to know each other more casually first, but for the time being I was going to leave her alone until she is ready to talk more. She replied back to that and seemed to appreciate it, and we haven’t spoken again since last night. I hope I did the right thing. 

Here is her exact response to my email:

“Thank you (me)...I agree with everything you said. And I honestly appreciate you reading the situation so well. You’re really one of the most emotionally intelligent people I’ve ever met. Thank you for making me feel so safe. I do think that we both aren't in a healthy enough mental state to start something right now. But I would love to work on getting to know you in a no pressure way.”

How does this seem to y’all? Am I overthinking? Am I in a good place and just need to throttle back and play it super cool? Do I need to pursue if she doesn’t text me first within a few days?

relationship_advice,"I 28F have a friend 26F who keeps telling everyone I have herpes. And I do. I've known her since middle school but we reconnected about 4 years ago and I confided that I caught it from an abusive relationship and just wanted to feel accepted. She made me feel accepted but then told all of our mutual friends. She told my boyfriend 30M while we were in the talking stage before I got to tell him. And when I did, he had told me that he already knew because she told him. I ignored it. 
She is an ex stripper and has stripper friends who are 19 and 22, she told them. I called her out on it because I had only told her and my bf. She had the strippers come up with the extravagant lie that they had heard it from a girl that my bf went to highschool with but he doesnt even have it. She told her brother in law that I had it and he heard it from her. She told all of our mutual friends and they have told me that she told them. 
I'm on medication for it and it's not easily passable but I'm just hurt that she does that to me.
My real question is do I just cut contact and block her or do I message her one last time and explain why this is my last message to her? Or how should I handle this? Either way, we aren't friends anymore.

relationship_advice,"We started an year and a half ago as friends who hooked up drunk, and then grew closer everyday since. 
I am an extrovert and precastincater. He is an introvert procastinator. Thus a lot of our situations and moments happen when I initiate, including the starting, asking out, date ideas, trips, future plans, patch ups, conflicts, conflict resolutions, etc. He doesn't see the importance of communication, and I think that's the most important factor and I believe the root cause. He is always in and excited when things happen, but just wouldn't initiate. He is confortable seeing how things role and acting need basis. And not defining paths and taking charge.

This has started making me wonder if I am imposing myself onto.him and if I chose not to lead or initiate, will the relationship exist? He steps aside any moment given. He dumped me once because situation required him taking charge and that got me very worried.

How would you handle an individual, of close relationship to you, who constantly moans about their health issues, but doesn’t seek help from their GP about it, follow up any appointments, or manage their prescription meds appropriately? 

I’m a healthcare professional, this stuff grates me, but as this isn’t a professional relationship I’m just sort of stuck. 

Person in question has diagnosed health issues, but all of life’s difficulties and any new symptom or any bad day is ‘oh my X is playing up again’ or ‘oh, welcome to having X’ 

Today I snapped (three hours sleep after a night shift isn’t great so partly my fault for snapping) after interacting with this person, who said ‘you know I have problems with Y issue’ I said ‘well why don’t you go get Y checked out then!?’ 

Said person then stormed off in a huff and is now ignoring me. 

I get that it’s hard, and chronic illness is a battle every day. But this persons whole
Existence is their illness, however I can’t remember the last time they actually saw a physician. 

Any tips on how to handle this in future as I see this person very regularly.

He also told me a lot of his past trauma, and I was happy that he trusted me with that info. He even expressed jealousy at me talking to a married man in a very friendly manner, saying the guy just wanted to sleep with me. I didn’t get those vibes since he told me about his wife early on and he just shared his music with me and asked about my day. But I cut him off anyway to appease him. 
 
However is he very sexual and gets pouty when I don’t adhere sometimes. I didn’t feel like it once so I suggested he find someone else who could meet his needs and he got really upset at that and stopped talking to me a bit later. Then the next day out of the blue, he asked me to be his girlfriend. After I said yes he vanished. Poof. 

What the hell is going on?

relationship_advice,"Okay, I'll be brief with everything!

Basically this guy (20M) hit me up on social media a few months ago, we started hanging out, everything was good. Then we caught feelings for each other and eventually told each other. Since then it's been so weird, we've been talking for two months and he hasn't made any effort to make a move. He's held my hand, but that's about it, plus he only holds it for a few minutes before letting go. He never calls our hang outs ""dates"" even though they are like dates. Last night we went to the movies and he didn't try to make any moves. It just seems like something is holding him back and I don't know what? It feels like I'm being led on or used because no talk of anything romantic has come up, we haven't spoke about a relationship, non of that.

Has anyone been through something like this? What does it mean when a guy acts like this?

relationship_advice,"Tl;dr at the bottom!!

So im black and my partner is white and every time we have conversations that somehow relate to race they usually end up with him or both of us becoming frustrated and i dont know how to remedy it. He feels like i disregard his opinions on race because hes white which isnt the case at all, but i do feel like he tries to compare the experiences and it reads to me as “well white people also get shit on too” which ive never said doesnt happen but i have said its never going to be on the same level as what black people have/do go through.

He used the example of black people being called white and perceives that as white people being seen as “not cool” instead of what i said which was it read as “not being black enough”. I told him myself and many close friends of mine have experienced this in early childhood and thought he’d understand that its not really an insult towards white people and (when you really think about it) actually paints black people in a negative light. He said his interpretation is how the kids in his school meant it (he lived in a predominantly black/brown neighborhood) and kinda just doubled down and talked about how he was teased in school for being white which i was sympathetic to and the conversation turned into him talking about how he was white and lived in a low income area and his family life wasnt the best and how situations don’t discriminate etc. . I understand where he was coming from and dropped my side of the discussion to comfort him (which no ill feelings towards that, his emotions are more important then me trying to prove a point) but i couldnt help but feel a bit defeated because these discussions usually end up with me comforting him and him not really understanding where im coming from. 

One time he told a racist joke that was basically about a homeless black guy cleaning himself and haha he was white all along!! He was just so dirty he was confused as a black guy haha xD!! As soon as he finished it i said “thats racist” and he said its not because he didnt intend it to be we got into a 4.5 hour conversation of me explaining A) why the joke was racist (he said it was just a silly little joke so i asked him to explain it to me like im stupid and he skipped over all of the racial elements which was literally the whole story and fell back on “its not that funny i just laugh at stupid things all the time yk this”) B) just because you didnt intend for a joke to be racist doesnt get rid of the fact that it is indeed racist but that doesnt make him racist (he kept saying i called him that when i said multiple times hes not) and C) why he should apologize for telling the joke and then doubling down on it when i called him out for it. The thing that ended it was me giving him an analogy of you leaving the toaster on and then setting the apartment on fire. You didnt mean to set the fire but the fire was started because of something you did. That doesnt make him an arsonist, but the least he could do is say sorry for being the cause of the fire. (Also wanna throw in that he went for an hour drive when we took a break from the discussion so he could clear his head/ he was a bit upset)

But the thing that caused me to make this post was today, i showed him a silly meme (“Mf” “fella” “my bruh” awww look who cant say N!GGA) and was laughing while doing so and he laughs and goes “fuck you suck my dick, i can say those” (him more then me but we talk to each other like that, i talk much worse to certain friends so im not mad ab that) but then he said he feels a bit jealous he cant bc hes not “part of the group” and in my head im like “??? Did you forget the history behind the word orr” and i was going to vocalize it in a more appropriate way but thought that would be a terrible idea and just laughed it off instead. He got upset bc he said i was acting like “ugh omg i cant deal with you rn white boy” (which is definitely a projection because he accuses me of this every time, as well as his best friend whos also black when they have racial conversations) which wasnt my intent at all and i told him so and he said “well that’s literally what you just did so…” and i told him i was going to say something but opted not to because it would turn into a whole thing and i dont want to do that right now. He said its not fair and he wants to know and that we had conversations about growth and how i should put faith in him. I said every time we had these conversations i out faith in him and he said that made him feel upset. I apologized but doubled down and said i really dont want to tell him and he left not long after in a huff. (Forgot exactly when but at some point he made a “joke” in response to the meme and said “at least i can get a loan” and i said that joke is a diff genre of joke and he said “its in the ball park because they both revolve around race”)

Is there anything i can do to help prevent our discussions from blowing up this way? Its so tiring to have to constantly do damage control but not really feel like the same level of consideration is given to me.

relationship_advice,"Hey everyone. First time poster, long time lurker. My girlfriend (39F) and I (30F) got into a kinda drunk argument last night about one of my coworkers (23M) after spending and amazing day together. 

She’s been feeling a little insecure about him because he’s a transguy (I live in Portland, OR where most people are queer or trans to some extent) and I’ve dated trans guys in the past, knowing fully well that I am really gay, so it never worked out because I wasn’t into them. We’ve got into a fight like this before over another coworker, who is also a transguy, and I assured her over and over again that there’s literally nothing there and that she has nothing to worry about. 

Last night our store had a team building exercise for about two hours, and all of my coworkers, who are my friends decided to go to a gay bar which my girlfriend and I were there literally right before the meeting grabbing drinks. It isn’t out of the ordinary for us to hang out with my coworkers at this gay bar. So I asked her if she wanted to come with us to grab drinks and she said no we had plans to hang out after and watch our show. So then I asked her if she would be OK if I grabbed one drink with my coworkers. She asked who was there and I listed about seven coworkers, including the one that shes insecure about and she got angry because she’s uncomfortable with this guy and doesn’t trust him and me being around each other and that I should’ve known better/ had her back by just coming home. 

When I got home, we started arguing and I know I get defensive, which doesn’t help my case and ends up not validating her feelings. I tried to tell her that like there’s nothing there between this coworker and I, and that I’m solely devoted to her. It also didn’t help that we were both kind of drunk and she was in her feelings and so was I. She told me she doesn’t want me to work with this person anymore but I can’t control the schedule and I feel like that puts me in a really weird position to talk to my manager about me not working with this person because my girlfriend feels insecure about it.

Anyway, how does someone help another person with an insecurity like this? Like how do I make her feel comfortable with the fact I have to work with this person and also that we’re kind of friends? My girlfriend knows that I would never cheat on her. It never ever crosses my mind because I’m in love with HER and ONLY her. I’m not into my coworker like that. He’s not even to me like that. I honestly think he’s gay and likes boys and I’ve told her that so I don’t know what to do. I’m honestly looking for advice on how to handle this. Please don’t bash my girlfriend or give sarcastic remarks. I need some honest advice on things I can say/do to help alleviate some of these insecurities within her. 

TL;DR: my girlfriend feels insecure about a trans guy coworker of mine even though him and I are just friends and we are both gay, and I need help alleviating this insecurity of hers.",0,My (30F) girlfriend (39F) is insecure about one of my coworkers.

It was a very toxic relationship, physical and mental abuse were involved. she broke up with him but he was unable to accept this and started to stalk her, he used to message her daily. He used to curse her daily and call her many bad names (you know what I mean). I thought about helping her by talking to him face-to-face. I tried to manipulate him that she was not worth it and asked him to leave her alone but it totally backfired. He started to abuse her even more, she started crying telling me no one asked me to do it and I should have minded my own business. she says that I betrayed her trust and to an extent, I did betray her.

relationship_advice,"Title is not totally accurate. I would say that i'm scared of physical intimacy with the opposite sex, despite them being what i'm attracted to, as an heterosexual man. I have however female friends that i can get along with and i have no problems with. I always prefer hanging out with men but i have no problems with women. But the physical intimacy make me scared so much. I talk with it with my therapist but we struggle to find a reason to and how to resolve it, so im looking for advice here.

I am scared of women. Friend on mine recently tell me to create a tinder account as we're joking sometimes that i'm the forever alone dude in our friend group. I used to get some matches and some girls messaged me. I never answered. Too scared. In the same way, at a party, a girl take my hand to dance with me, i dance with her like one minute then i say i dont want to dance. I know its not always romantic and this girl probably doesnt have anything behind her and she just wanted to have fun but i couldnt. Im basically cockblocking myself.

&amp;#x200B;

So if we look at my romantic past with girls, it is a little empty. I never had a girlfriend, im also a virgin. I used to struggle with loneliness, but today i feel i'm okay with being alone (part of it is because i realized i was scared of sharing my intimacy), except for some time where i tell myself ""oh that would be cool to have a girlfriend"" but its not really often. I used to have some events with girls but it has been often negative (i will describe it later). I recently asked myself if i was gay. I dont think so, i recognize when a man is attractive and i can have some look at men, but it's like you know watching a beautiful structure, it's not sexual attraction. I have been sexually assaulted by a boy (i posted it some days ago it was a friend of mine) that i only realized recently. The feeling of it disgusts me and i was not turned on at all. So no i'm not homosexual.

Something i'm thinking about is that i'm scared of just showing my flaws. I am an emotional and fragile person: i have mental health issues such as dysmorphia and OCD. There are some periods where i'm really fragile and something can make me cry easily. But i will never cry in public. So that could be a reason, i dont want to show my flaws. And as all my life i get better with men than women, women could come as more scary than men. Something that comfort me in this theory is that its more easy for me to confess to my father than my mother.

Another theory is that i'm scared of disappointing someone. To go back to the dance episode with the girl, i dont know how to dance. And i think it scared me of continuing to dance with this girl. I could also be scared of not being a good partner, not being good in bed, or not making her happy.

I had some bad experiences with girls that could also create this fear:

\-Got bullied at elementary and middle school. It was girls for the majority. At elementary there was you know like a know-it-all girl, the first in class, and as i was the second, she couldnt bare me having excellent grades like her. So she would diminish me, mocking me, and was mean. At middle school i had a crush on a girl, and when she learned it, she focused me. She insulted me, hit me etc and then her female friends do the same. The bullying stops when i say i had a crush on an other girl. 

\-At the end of high school, there was a girl that had a crush on me. I try to date her, not because i liked her, but because i was like ""hey its rare that a girl like you so take the chance"" (i know its stupid but i was an immature 17 years old boy). Turns out she wanted to have sex with me and i say i was really uneasy to show my body etc and she called me a prude. I cut contacts with her.

\-fall in love with a girl. It was the most amazing experience i have felt. She doesnt reciprocate my feelings and i was heartbroken. We stayed friends but we dont talk really much today. i dont have feelings for her anymore

So what do you think? what can i do to stop being so scared? what is the reason for you for this fear?",0,I [22M] am scared of the opposite sex [20-25F],r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8869225,1682525041,0,1682525060,1682525060,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,9,809

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend (21m) and I (22f) have been together for around 3 years, and have lived together for about as long. We began as friends in high school, so we always had a very informed understanding of what we wanted out of a future as well as those talks getting more specific as we have been together. Since my preteen years I’ve had no desire to live in the USA and have always wanted to move to Europe. He has known this since we were teens and sometime last year I had nailed down the country, started calculating finances and other needs to begin the process of what would be a very intense move, but with no plan of leaving for a few years yet. My boyfriend had always gone along with this and sounded excited to go. A week ago this all shattered when he had gotten off the phone with a friend chatting about new jobs/future plans, and I casually asked why he didn’t mention our plan. And he just very frankly said that he had never wanted to go and hoped I would just give up on it. There were a number of other things said in the first few days that really impacted my view of our relationship, and have been left feeling lied to and unsure. I took a few days to think about it and sort of decided that I should stay with him and we could pursue a future in the USA. The thing that is eating at me though is I have many reasons for wanting to move, ranging from general safety of us and a future family to just interest and accessibility to the rest of Europe. He has only one reason being he wouldn’t be able to see his family whom we do not visit very often. And the state he’s agreed to move to in the future is a further drive than the european country would have been a flight, which i do understand is wildly different. Point being I don’t have family to go and talk to about this, so I just can’t seem to sort out what the best route to go here is because if I look at the timeline of my life I’ve loved him for as long as I’ve wanted to move out of the country.

relationship_advice,"Hello Reddit,

I'm seeking some advice on a recent breakup with my girlfriend of 3 years. It was unexpected and I'm struggling to understand what happened.

Some background: My girlfriend, who we'll call Sonnu , used to be very loving and attentive towards me. She would call and text me 24/7, we would go on dates, and she was playful and affectionate. We also shared common interests, such as playing Xbox together.

However, recently, Sonnu went through some changes. She started taking medication for mental health issues and even went to a mental hospital. This was a surprise to me as she had mentioned these struggles before didn’t think she was this bad. Despite this, she continued to be affectionate towards me.

But then one day, Sonnu suddenly told me that she didn't feel any attraction towards me anymore. It was a shock, as we had a seemingly healthy relationship before. She mentioned feeling guilty about not finding me attractive anymore, even though she used to be very loving towards me. She used to have sexual attraction towards be the first year or two but after that NONE 

Here are some of the text messages from our conversation about the breakup:

[yes I used ChatGTP to summarize it up because it’s long..]

Based on our conversation, it seems that Sonnu is feeling unsure about her feelings for me and expressed the need for time to think and talk to her therapist or sister before making any decisions about our relationship. She mentioned feeling attracted to others but not feeling the same attraction towards me anymore, which made her feel guilty. She also mentioned the possibility of taking a break from each other and keeping the streaks (possibly referring to a social media feature), but I offered to let go of the streaks if she was not interested.

Sonnu mentioned that she needed time to think and talk to her sister about the situation on Tuesday and expressed apologies and uncertainty about our relationship. It seems that the conversation ended with Sonnu mentioning that it might be officially over, and I expressed understanding and offered support.

I'm feeling confused and hurt by this sudden change in my relationship. I still care deeply for Sonnu and want to understand what happened. Has anyone experienced a similar situation or has any advice on how to cope with a breakup in this context? I would appreciate any insights or suggestions.

It’s been a month I didn’t cry or feel hurt but man how she ended the relationship left me in shock..

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend says that he absolutely needs sex in order to feel loved, and nothing else I do for him matters (which I think is BS). No matter what I do or how much I kiss and cuddle him, he’s said to me multiple times now that there’s no point in just kissing or cuddling unless sex is going to come after. I’ll be completely happy kissing him but the second he tries to move things further and I say no, his attitude completely changes and he barely wants to continue. He says he respects my boundaries and the fact that I don’t have to but uses his excuse that he only feels loved by having sex as a way to guilt me into it, which is the reason I don’t want to (i feel like I have to). There’s no compromise to this situation. Either I have sex to keep him happy, and I’m hurt, or I don’t have sex to keep myself happy, and he’s hurt. 

This has been an argument point for years now in our relationship and I’m tired of it and want to leave. I need advice on how to go about it.

relationship_advice,"Am I missing something here?

So I just started dealing with this guy that I have had previous relations with before. Thing is before it was only a mutual fwb situation. He ended up getting back with his ex and respectfully told me about it before he even did. It didn’t bother me too much because I never got attached. That was over a year or 2 ago. He spent probably the past 4 or 5 months trying to get me back . Talking to me here and there . Finally about a month in a half ago I started talking to him more . Now here is where I think I may have messed up because quite honestly in the beginning I wasn’t sure what I wanted . 

Because how often we were talking before hanging out I felt as if I would catch feelings if we were to get back to where we were before and I was nervous about it . He asked what’s wrong with that ? I told him it complicates everything . And if I did catch feelings I’d cutt him off he said no .. ain’t no cutting me off you can take a break if you need to . And from that I took it as him not wanting me to catch feelings . We have had sex ( which is literally the best sex I ever had in my life ) a few times now and it’s definitely happening . I caught feelings 🤦🏻‍♀️ the problem is after sex we will text a couple days here and there but then he disappears. If I text him we have good convo but if I don’t I don’t hear from him . I’m sure he thinks I just want to have sex with him and that’s all because that was our previous arrangement and I’m scared to scare him away with my emotions. Really I just want to hear from him here and there and thinking I don’t cross his mind when he stays on mine is driving me crazy. Should I be honest ? Or should I let it go because I honestly feel like it’s just not knowing how he feels is what is making me overthink it .

During all this time of us seeing each other he has been keeping in contact with his ex from high school.

relationship_advice,"My mum has been asking me to increase her allowance along w my increments in pay/bonus/AWS etc since I’ve more “working experiences” hence higher pay she should get more too. However I personally think that it is not that reasonable as I have more bills to pay for and my personal expenses do increase as well as I grew older.

A little context about my fam, I’m from a low income fam (only child) and back when I was schooling my fam was under the financial assistance scheme aka SAF and my dad is working in a factory w $2k/mth currently before CPF deductions and my mum is a housewife. She hasn’t been working since I’m born and the reason why she’s still not working because she’s diagnosed with severe OCD. What I meant by OCD here is not the typical OCD y’all hear from your friends, it’s the type that would require to undergo psychiatric treatments and she’s currently on pills too. Basically she doesn’t allow anyone to be home without her around. She has her own routine that all must follow otherwise she’ll begin to feel that the house is dirty and she go through tonless of repeated cleaning process if she accidentally thinks of smth that’s unclean. Same goes for deliveries as well, if it’s not collected under her supervision she will hv an extremely hard time to bring it into the house etc.

So a little bit about me, I’m a poly grad and been working for close to 4 years, currently 23 right now, drawing a salary of $3.5k/mth. I used to work another part time job which brings me about $1.5-2k extra back then, so a total of close to $6k/mth before deductions. I have personal goals to achieve in life in terms of monetary, where I’m looking to own a car and being financially ready to purchase a flat by 30 yrs old, and I’m diligently saving money and doing consistent investment with an insurance plan as well. I’m a strong believer that as a female, I should be financially independent and not rely on anyone, even my future husband.

The current house I lived in with my parents are from a bank loan of about $250k currently. My name is used (combined w my dad name) for the bank loan to increase the amount loan + years take to return, else my fam can’t go for the loan. Both my parents are in their mid 50 alr  and my dad is gonna retire by 65 (if he can even work till 65) and I’ll be the one paying the loans. If he stops working at 65, by then the loan will be left with about $150k I guess. Also, because my name is used for the loan, naturally my name is in the property as well, which means I can no longer go for BTO or second hand HDB flats, I can only go for condo, which stresses me so much with the financial burden on me, and whether my future husband would be able to understand my situation. This is also why I’m working double jobs and lasted for 1yr+ but I can no longer cope with that so I’m left with 1 job.

Back then i was giving her $550/mth when working 2 jobs but she felt it was very less. She compared me to my cousins saying that they’re giving more than $500 w a $4-5k/mth salary while I’m earning more than them. She asked me to give her more but I really couldn’t afford it. I have many bills under me. I spend about $100-250/mth on transport, $700/mth (investment/savings under insurance), $300/mth on loan, $800-$1k/mth on personal expenses that includes food, going out, online shopping etc, $550/mth allowance for my mum, remaining will be savings in my bank as I’m saving up for my Uni cost which cost about a total of $30-$35k. My mum claims that it’s overboard that I’m saving $2k/mth but that’s because I do not want to drag too long for my Uni education. In fact with $2k/mth it takes about 3 full years of working time to accumulate the full sum. I’m thinking about saving up full sum before going to part time Uni while working full time as soon I’ll be the one that starts to pay the house loan w about $1/k mth in cash.

Now I’m getting $3.5k/mth before deductions, and I’m giving my mum $350/mth and she became more upset about it. I cut down on my personal expenses to about $600-$800/mth and amount of money I save in my bank/mth (saving about $900+/mth) while the rest remain the same.

I could not reason out with her as she is always comparing and says that I’m too stingy with her when it comes to money but she does not understand that I have my financial goals to achieve too. On top of monthly allowance, she expects me to pay for her shopping expenses, she wants me to sponsor her to travel w my dad. She thinks that I should give more because they’ve been feeding me and raising me, and she claims that no amount of allowance can give back to what she had done as a mother.

He has a history of depression and ai tried to deal with the pain of miscarriages on my own and fear I may have made him feel alienated. We finally had a baby and 7 weeks later he told me he didn't love me. It's been a roller coaster ride ever since. He would go through periods when he would want to work things out. I eventually found out he was talking to a girl he briefly dated in high-school. One we had issues with before with him texting over 12 years ago. It's been a little over a year of back and forth. Should I reach out to her to see if I am able to move forward from it? She doesn't know we have a kid and lots of other things.

relationship_advice,"Before we got together two years ago, my boyfriend was in a long, abusive relationship. When they were together, his ex physically and emotionally harmed him and controlled a lot of his life. Some of this continued when we first started dating, and it has been a real journey to get to the point where he no longer answers her calls and texts (she lives in another state).

His childhood best friend and his fiancee met the ex through him when they were together, and they remain good friends with the ex despite knowing about the abuse. They went to the ex's parents' house for Thanksgiving this past year and the fiancee recently went on a trip with her. They have never been to visit us or my boyfriend solo before we were together.

Now, the friend is getting married. The wedding is in a month, and we would have to travel to attend. I am sure the ex is invited, and whether or not she attends, I'm not comfortable with these friends continuing such a close friendship with someone who caused my boyfriend (and me by proxy) so much harm. My boyfriend still considers the groom to be a close friend and wants to go to the wedding. 

I'm torn because my boundary with this seems to be at a different place than my boyfriend's. I wouldn't want him to go to the wedding alone, and I can't imagine having a good time at the wedding knowing the couple is so close with this abusive person. Not to mention if she does attend, I cannot be in the same as her knowing what I know. 

So what can I do?",0,My (30F) boyfriend (31M) wants to go to a small wedding where his abusive ex will be,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8868954,1682522398,0,1682522417,1682522417,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,17,281
relationship_advice,"This is gonna be a long post so bear with me here. So me (18M) and my gf (18F) have been dating for a little over a year now. We started out as good friends and it progressed on to a relationship. In the beginning we used to talk a lot like a lot lot. It started during the whole online class saga and then when schools reopened we did have some trouble getting over all the awkwardness from transitioning online to offline but we made it through.

She is introverted whereas I'm a bit more outgoing but out friend circle is the same and her friends and my friends are the same people. Now coming to the topic, so over the last couple of months I've been noticing a change in the way she is with me. She went from having full on conversations to now barely sending anything. Our conversations now is almost like a 10 min convo stretched for 10 days. Suppose I send her a message right now then she'll probably reply to me the next day or next night and that too just for the sake of it. If I send 10 messages she'll reply to the last one with single line. I've tried telling her I'm not exactly happy with where the relationship is heading and she says she sorry and she doesn't have time and then during the day I' see her posting stories and liking other pictures and what not yet I'II only hear from her either late at night or the next night yea she's on a 24 hours reply cycle it seems. We can't exactly meet right now because of college admissions and exams so this is the only way to make things work. It's not like she's too busy to reply I see her active on social media while I stand and wait for her replies like an idiot. You might be thinking ""oh it's just due to stress or exams and whatnot"" but I don't even get proper replies man. I send her messages on Snapchat and wait for like 5-6days to get a reply while her snap scores go up and up everyday and this has been going on for months yea months. Her replies are very cynic and almost as if she's doing it just for the sake of it.

I tried suggesting her trying some apps for long distance to maybe let each other know what we're up to and nope she doesn't want it. I tried suggesting alternative ways to talk other than Instagram or Snapchat and nope it's all fine and yea you guessed it I get treated like an afterthought yet again. Before we used to sext and do all that stuff to spice things up which was basically me sending writing stuff to her and yea but we called it sexting because you know we like keep things a bit fancy.
1 used to be a bit flirtatious while texting and yup she doesn't want that as well. Then a couple of weeks back I thought of creating an Instagram account where we both will post pictures of us together and maybe some memes about us well guess what I did all the work and she likes them and leaves them there. She used to have problem with me talking to a certain person and stopped talking to them. She didn't want the school authorities to sniff things out about us so we pretty much stopped walking together in and around school which was the only place we only meet irl (btw we're from India in a school run by missionaries so yea they don't tolerate relationships at all).

Previously whenever I was upset about her ignoring me and stuff I wrote her paragraphs and then they get left on sent for days and i unsend it. A couple of days back we had out last of school and we were all dressed up and I asked her if she wanted to you know talk because we might not meet for months and nope too risky. She even refused to take some photos together but in the end our friends compelled and somehow we got some. And no our friends don't know about what's happening between us except for our mutual best friend. The final straw came when I messaged her a couple of days back about us barely trying to keep the relationship together and she admitted to ignoring me and blamed it on hormones and no social energy. But this has been going on for months MONTHS for heavens sake. I'm sorry if this sounded like a rant to you because I have no clue what to do and pls ignore any errors.

relationship_advice,"So for some context me and me and my gf have been together for 5 months roughly and 2 months ago she met her new male best friend at a party I attended as well. They just had a chat but later they met at her local gym. We don’t live very close to each other so we don’t go to the same gym or meet more than maybe 1-2 times a week.
 She met the guy and they started working out more and more frequently. Now it has come to the point where it’s not only working out but they hang out at her place whenever she has other friends over as well (so they’re never there alone), and he drives her around everywhere.
 In addition she told me he tried to hit on her when he was drunk but changed his mind because he knew about my relationship with her but he still does things I consider flirting with her like tickling her and wrestling her. Whenever they hang out together she answers me less and a couple days ago when he was there she didn’t answer me for hours. Eventually when she answered she said she talked with him about our relationship and he thinks it’s a bad idea that we’re together and she needed some time to think. 
I know this might sound hopeless and that I should probably just leave her but I know she’s not cheating with him my problem is that he definitely would step in at any chance and have tried to ruin the relationship but she won’t stop hanging with him because she says it’s her new best friend. Whenever I tell her I really don’t like that they’re hanging together she just thinks I’m jealous and tries to assure me nothing is going on between them and we always end up arguing about this. Recently she told me she is so tired of the arguing that she don’t know how much longer she can take it.

relationship_advice,"Description: Me (25M) and my wife (27F) have been debating whether to share this with the Reddit world to get some advice or not. It’s almost too much to type so please bear with me as I try to give you a condensed version of our lives the last 6 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

My wife and I have been togther for 6 years and married for almost 3 years. We love each other and to be honest she is my best friend and I know I’m her best friend as well. We do everything togther from grocery shopping to home Reno’s to gardening even our occasional gaming. We just really enjoy doing things togther and being around each other all of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

The In-Laws:

My wife’s parents when I first met them were incredible. They made me feel safe and comfortable, and then things changed. I came from an abusive home where I was physically abused and I never had a relationship with my mother. So her mom in a way became my mom and her dad my dad. I started to open up to them and be more comfortable and felt like I had a family. Now I was also younger when I met them and I was going through so many different phases from dropping out of school to trying to make money working at different jobs. After 4 months of dating things took a turn. 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw how controlling they were over their other daughters (24F) life and the things they would say about her. My wife seemed okay with it and I just went a long. One day I had to leave my rental unit because of a whole dramatic university friendship mess. (Long other story). They offered for me to live with them until I found a new spot. I was uncomfortable but took them up on the offer. Now the rules were I slept in the guest room and my wife (girlfriend then) slept in her bedroom which was downstairs. I was cool had no issues and agreed with them as to why. A day goes by and the mother switches. I saw another side of her she was angry all the time whispering stuff about me and acted like she didn’t want me around. She told my wife that she heard me sneaking downstairs (Reddit I have nothing to hide lol but I honestly didn’t do any of that). I respect them too much to even do that or break their trust in me. They ended up making it really awkward to me within 2 days I wanted to move out asap! One night my wife, her sister and I were all sitting on her bed (literally just sitting) and talking and the mom comes down takes one look in the room looses her shit and walks away. Tells my wife that I have disrespected their house rules etc. At this point I feel terrible and uncomfortable so with what little money I had I got a hotel for the night. The next day amazingly I found a rental unit for an amazing price (ended up living there for 3 years, it was an amazing little place until we bought a house). I went with my wife to her house to ask her parents and brother (they have two huge trucks) if they can help me move just my bed to the house so I have something to sleep on. The brother said no because I disrespected them. The mom said it was too late and no (9pm). Keep in mind they do live 25mins away from the rental until but it’s a small town no traffic and I just need a bed so I can sleep on that night and the next day pick my stuff up. The mom ignored me the whole time did not even acknowledge me or anything. I was so pissed off, ended up sleeping in my wife’s car lol I know stupid I should have just slept on my rental units floor with blankets (my young dumb moment). 

&amp;#x200B;

The incident drives my wife to kind of stand up for herself and express how she felt they treated me. They raged at her got angry told/called me horrible things. Now this is probably where I screwed up but I did apologize to them face to face and we have moved on since then. Shortly after the whole move out situation (4-5 months into us dating), my wife told her parents she wants to talk and her sister who agreed with everything my wife wanted to talk with her joined as well. I told my wife to have me on the phone on speaker and I’ll mute my phone because I wanted to hear what they’re going to say about me. Long story short they opened up with just horrible things about me. That I’m a cult leader that I have brainwashed her and that I’m controlling her and that they all see it. Meanwhile her sister (who is my wife’s best friend) knows me very well and was denying their whole statement. Anyways long story short they said that it is disgusting that we can spend so much time togther and that it’s not healthy and it’s wrong (my in laws have a broken marriage more to come on that maybe next post if people are interested). Then….. my phone lost service and hung up… she was on speaker and it made the noise (the hang up noise). I got caught they knew I was on the phone and they kicked my wife out of the house and her sister. They packed their things came to my place and stayed and the whole night received emails and texts about how they are kicked out and that was the last straw. Being older now I realize I would be embarrassed too if someone I was talking shit about was on the phone listening to it lol but in all seriousness my wife and her sister got a rental place and then few months later I took her parents out to a restaurant apologized sincerely and we all moved forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I at this point have been togther for about a year and I started to learn some really dark messed up stuff about her childhood and she started to open up more about the parents and different things about her childhood. Nothing was ever really the same it was like we brushed everything under a carpet and didn’t deal with the actual issues. The mom and dad wanted control over all their kids in every aspect and because my wife was becoming independent standing up for herself not letting herself be pushed around by them they took it as me being controlling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Marriage:

When we got engaged my mother in law planned everything and even where I was going to purpose and told me she would be apart of it. I didn’t want that but I went a long because I knew if I didn’t she would be upset. After we got engaged she wouldn’t leave us alone (we took a small road trip 3 hours across the border to the states, we live in Canada). She wouldn’t let me and wife get some time alone to talk hangout and celebrate being newly engaged. The wedding was a covid wedding (2020) mother in law planned everything and bought everything she wanted and didn’t even consult us. There was only 10 people at the wedding just my family and hers but they did everything without even asking us. I’m truly grateful that they paid for the food and some decorations and allowed us to have it at their beautiful house. But it felt like our wedding day was not about us but then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pregnancy:

My wife got pregnant last year and currently we have our little one. During her pregnancy they mentioned multiple times about her loosing the baby. It was not funny my wife who is already stressed was even more worried. They would say “we don’t want to buy anything now in case you loose the baby”…. Ummmm okay?  And then my wife was 4.5 months pregnant and asked her mom about the baby shower and her mom said “we don’t do the baby shower until after the baby has come in case you loose the baby”! My wife said that she wanted the baby shower before the baby was born so she was prepared and had stuff for when the baby is here (I am currently in school so we basically make enough to just get by, so the baby gifts would help us be prepared for when the baby came). My mother in law freaked out made it about her self and how she’s the one planning it so she gets to say if it is after the baby is born.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I cut them off for about 7 months. It was the hardest thing my wife had to do. She wanted to because she was so hurt that her dad and mom kept saying that she would loose her kid. The dad kept harassing us the whole time with texts and emails. My brother in law came to our house and told my wife what kind of man I am that I can’t even tell my wife to go back home to her parents. The brother in law showed up to our house spit at our house and yelled at my wife all while she was 8 months pregnant. My wife had me stay upstairs when he came and she didn’t allow him in the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

We sent an invite to my mother in law about the baby shower, but she said she probably wasn’t going to come. Anyways the baby shower comes around and her sister and I throw it. I decided to give my wife the best baby shower she could have. I didn’t have money (I went back to school for electrical engineering (almost done)). But we made it work. The day of the baby shower my wife gets a text message from her aunt saying her mom is coming. It’s been like 7 months since we last spoke or saw her. We were nervous kind of ruined the moment but whatever. Now I was at the baby shower only to take pictures but no be involved. I had a nice DSLR camera I stayed in the background taking pics. The mom comes in with NO GIFTS and was crying the whole baby shower. Everyone was confused. She was talking during the games being loud and disrespectful. She told my wife’s cousins and aunties the half truth, said stuff about me and then made it a pitty party about her. Why even come to the shower if you aren’t even gonna pretend to be okay. Literally ruined the baby shower and we worked hard. SHE DIDN’T EVEN BRING A GIFT. 

&amp;#x200B;

After our baby was born: 

Long story short we had our baby and we allowed her parents to come see him in our time but there was a disconnect. They didn’t bring gifts for him until he was 2 months old. They only gave us one meal and then blamed us after for not asking them to drop food off for us and really didn’t offer any help in any sort of way. They said we don’t allow them to be involved in our kids life, but me and my wife were trying to ease into all of this and work through it.  Currently we asked for some space because of another situation. In December my MIL left my FIL and in my FILs rage, he called my parents and told them everything about me and the things I told them in confidence when I met them about my abuse as a kid he also said that I am a waste of money, for my parents to stop supporting us (they aren’t), that I hate my sister and her husband, we are cult leaders and so many other things. There is so much more to the situation that I can post another post if people would like to hear that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways Reddit what do we do? We know that the mother in law is a narcissist we have so many more stories and we just are done with them. But we don’t also want our baby to grow up without grand parents. Anyways I just wanted to vent sorry for this long post! If you want more context I’ll try to respond to every comment and I can make another post about more stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

relationship_advice,"So the thing is I don’t know how to handle the situation. We’re going trough a rough time lately in our relationship. I had a serious talk with him about it the other night and now I’ll have to wait and see if things change. But I’m unsure of how to handle the car situation which I tried to address to him without succes. 
I’m not much for asking for money directly. 

My fiancés car got wrecked about a month ago, so of course I let him use my car. He needed to go to work and I was on sick leave at that time. He has been very greedy with filling fuel on my car and basically only covered what he’s been using - maybe less than that. I don’t keep count of the kilometers. 
He has also used the car to visit his parents and other normal things he usually would do in his own car. So he has driven a lot of kilometers. He also drives the car very rough and I have commented multiple times on it, but he just wipes my comments away. He accelerates very roughly. 
My car is a older car and I haven’t paid it off yet, i bought it with help from my mother. I really really love this car. It drives amazingly, it’s fits me perfectly and I have learned a lot from it. I love fixing things myself so if a part is worn out I replace it myself with the help of a YouTube guide. I really love putting time, energy and learning from this car. 

My fiancé has since then gotten a new job and he got a company car, so he doesn’t need to use my car for transportation to work anymore. I told him he didn’t need to buy a new car and he could use mine as long as we share expenses. But I feel like he hasn’t taken initiative. I told him multiple times that he needs to fill the tank full. He has filled the tank once since his car wrecked. I told him I had payed insurance and all the other expenses. He doesn’t offer to pay anything. He knows I haven’t paid the car off. It feels kinda leeching. Because what am I supposed to do when the car is used up and I haven’t paid it off? He also uses the car and now I need to pay more insurance because the car drives more kilometers. 
The other day I drove my friend to the hospital and he told me I needed to remember to get gas money from my friend - I told him off and said I can make that decision myself and this friend doesn’t owe me anything, she does a lot for me and is a great help. 
My mother has also told me her discomfort of the whole situation. She says she wants the best for me and doesn’t wanna get involved but she fears of me getting used.

relationship_advice,"Boyfriend of 9 months said that lately he has been feeling a disconnect between us and I’m not sure what it means and it’s giving me anxiety. Our relationship has been hands down the best relationship of my life. My bf is so kind, loving, adventurous, every time we meet I have a great time. We haven’t really had a single fight ever. 

Over the past few weeks he has been as affectionate as always, planned fun dates for us, texting me as usual. Perhaps the only thing I noticed were some quiet pauses sometimes but I couldn’t really attribute it to anything. 

He has been working a lot, I have a lot of projects coming up as well, so we have both been pretty busy. The past couple of weeks we were not able to have sex due to some circumstances but we were otherwise physically affectionate with each other. 

All of a sudden, after not responding to a few of my texts about my day, he tells me that he has been feeling disconnected from me for at least a few weeks. I was at a loss. I’m not sure what he means by this at all. When I asked him, he said he can’t really put his finger on what it is, things have just been feeling off lately. I am completely freaking out.

relationship_advice,"***Honest feedback*** I’m in a weird love triangle of guys, living with an ex, planning a trip with an old “guy friend” and then meeting someone

I met this guy off Facebook dating, he lives 2h away but was willing to drive to meet me. At this time we were both off work so he wanted to drive out here so we could get to know each other. During this time I live with my ex and I’m house sitting for someone else and taking care of 5 dogs, a puppy and 6 cats and told him and he was totally fine and said he was willing to help out. 

Anyways I told him about the ex situation and that he’s looking into places (we’ve been broken up since Oct 22’). He wasn’t upset but had a lot of understandable questions that I answered honestly. He said he gets it. He was super helpful around the house, helped clean up dog accidents, took me to a vet appt and breakfast, then dinner to meet one of his friends. We’ve spent 1 whole day together and he starts saying he wants me to be his, he wants to be together etc. I told him I’d like to go a little slower and not put a label on things yet. He would repeatedly say after I told him that “man I just want you to be mine” and I would just kind of laugh.

Anyways we’ve now spent 2 days together, did the deed, asking me to be his gf etc. Well I have a trip that I planned with a “guy friend” in a different state back in January to go to the dominion republic in a few months. I felt it was my responsibility to be honest and tell him about this trip and he was very upset, understandably but I explained this is one reason why I don’t want to put a label on anything just yet because I know about this trip. I’ve only been talking to this guy for 3 days now and I never intended on meeting someone I’d be interested in or someone that “wants me to be his gf” so fast. He continued to say he wants to try and build something with me but that’s hard when I’m gonna go do the deed with  another guy. Which I do understand.

relationship_advice,I’ll first state that it was my decision but she brought it up while I was gaming and she was at her house. She said that I wasn’t paying attention to her too much. Note we went on dates every weekend or at least saw eachother every weekend when I didn’t have money to take us out. I wanted a little break of going out and doing anything to play the new RE4 Remake that came out and she agreed to give me that weekend. But the weekend comes and the first day of the weekend late at night she tells me she wants to talk and I ask if she’s ok and she says she’s not feeling the same because I’m not paying attention to her. Note we still talked that day on FaceTime and texting and everything it was all at night that I was playing. So I ask if she wanted to break up? She said yes. And I have fought for her for a long time. When she left to NY to be with her mom cause she’s a New York girl (my ex) and she stayed over there for like 2 months I waited and I even visited her for a weekend at like the “halfway” mark of her coming back. If I remember correctly I also bought her her plane ticket back to PR where her father and I live. So  at the time of her wanting to breakup I was exhausted. So tired of fighting for her and so tired of proving myself to her and it apparently being all for nothing. Also I had to fight so much to gain her trust. She was used before me so her trust and faith in men were broken. Before me she said she wouldn’t date for a while. Same thing happened for me. We didn’t look for eachother but we found eachother. Anyway she is the best girlfriend I’ve ever had in my life. She was my first everything. My first French kiss my first oral experience my first pussy. Basically my first sexual experience with a serious gf. I know it may sound bad how I said it but she was a lot of my firsts. I loved it. I loved every second of it. I’m so happy she was my first. Everything was almost perfect. I gave her flowers on special occasions like birthdays and valentines and I also gave her flowers on non special occasions like when she felt down or just because I wanted to give her some flowers. I went above and beyond for this girl. I don’t regret anything I ever did with her. I should say she constantly brought up breaking up but I did everything in my power to not do that. So my question is why after I did all this she wanted to breakup and why do I feel like shit still even though I wanted to breakup because she was basically suffocating me?,0,I (23M) broke up with my gf(22F) a couple weeks ago.,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8868810,1682520842,0,1682520855,1682520855,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,11,500

relationship_advice,"I am 30 years old and currently in a happy relationship with my 29 years old girlfriend. We have been together for 2 years and I believe this is the healthiest and happiest relationship I ever had.

I am currently considering proposing to her as I believe I am ready to take this step and I hope she feels the same way. But I find myself in a dilemma as to whether | should disclose certain information about my past to her before proposing.

I am unsure whether I should tell her about past relationships that we have not discussed yet (i.e., they did not come up at all). While I have been completely honest with her about everything up to this point, there are still certain things that we have not talked about. This relates to a specific past relationship that was serious enough to have an impact on my life (but it ended a couple of years ago and it is irrelevant and completely out of my life at this point.

I want to be completely honest snd transparent before proposing as I don't want to hide anything but my concern is that bringing it up out of the blow, without any context whatsoever, might cause unnecessary discomfort and problems for our relationship especially before I intend to propose to her (which is very soon...). I don't want to stir up any negative emotions or make her feel insecure about our relationship.

So my dilemma is around whether I tell her about this out of the blue or just not say anything since it didn't come up and go ahead with my plans to propose to her.

relationship_advice,"(19M- 21F) Does my bf (19 M) have an addiction? Hi I’m a 21 yr old  female and my bf is a We have both been together for almost 3 years now. 
So I (21 F)just found out this morning that my (19 M) bf has a ""porn"" addiction problem. Or at least that’s what he calls it. We had gone through a rough patch this past month and we were fine now but I (21 F) still had a bit anxiety like if he (19 M) was like seeing someone else or something. I (21 F) went thru his phone because it was right next to me (21 F) and he (19 M) was sleeping, so it was easy access, I’m (21 F) not proud of it but I just had to because I felt something was off. I (21 F) went automatically went thru his (19 M) hidden pictures, I just figured it would be the right place to look at. Tons and tons of years of storage of just pictures of anything of a girl (38 F) including a couple friends from their twitter links or instagram screenshots.
He (19 M) had built like this hidden insta account posed as like a girl and went on guests on twitter and there was so much because it's been happened for so long before relationships when he(19 M) was a lot younger. I (21 F) cried and yes I (21 F) actually beat his (19 M) butt awake, definitely felt demeaned and heartbroken. I’ve (21 F) asked if he (19 M) wants this if he (19 M) even loves me anymore. and he’s (19 M) replied saying he (19 M) loves me he (19 M) definitely wants this relationship, everything is just on a screen, as porn to get a load off when he’s (19 M) stressed, when I’m (21 F) gone and I (21 F) lack on giving him (19 M) pleasure. He (19 M) won't talk to a girl (45 FM)  in person or invite someone over. (Although he (19 M) has mentioned he (19 M) was talking to a girl because he was “lonely” but lead her (19 F) on and quickly shut it down, I (21 F) personally dont believe him (19 M) but he (19 M) has her (19 F) blocked so I’ll (21 F) leave it at that) he (19 M) told me (21 F) if he were to cheat or leave me for someone else he’d break up with me. But he (19 M) said he (19 M) doesn’t want to leave me (21F)  I (21F) told him it was still cheating and very messed up and straight up perverted. And super bizarre. He (19 M) said it's not but it is still a problem he (19 M) has on porn that's been going on for almost his (19 M) entire life, he (19 M) would literally have this as a deep secret he (19 M) wouldn’t let anybody know at all. it only happens once every two months and after this one time with one of our (21 F  19 M) first big fights. in his (19 m) words. I (21 F) dont know how to feel about it because he (19 M) lied to me (21 F),  he (19 M) said he (19 M) doesn't like porn like that which he continues to say is true ""I dont like seeing other people fucking which is why I have all these photos of girls n shit and povs it's a serious problem I have"". He (19 M) also says that even he gets grossed out and ashamed that he does this, not sure if I (21 F) should believe that either it’s very contradicting. I (21 F) love him (19 M) so much but this crossed a line but at the same time I (21 F) wanna help him (19 M)and he's (19 M) agreed to start getting into it more and be more experimental and we’ve (21 F. 19 M) decided to actually put in the work to get better. Yeah I'm (21 F) scared he's (19 M) gonna do it again but no I (21 F) gave him a second chance. But I (21F ) set my boundaries at him (19 M) , ""dont ducking do this again or we're thru and I’m (21 F) gonna sleep with one of your friends"". And he (19 M) said okay. He (19 M) said he (19 M) promised to not do it again ever in his (19 M) life since he (19 M) wants to be committed, I (21 F) had him (19 M) delete all of it including those accounts and unfollow any girl (34 F) that I know he screenshotted or posts lewd stuff. I (21 F) definitely pushed it aside when we made up like just accepting that men have a high sex drive and watching porn is generally what men do. But it just hurt when he (19 M) screenshotted a couple of my (21 F) friends posts. Dont matter if he (19 M) saw it as porn I’m (21 F) counting that as cheating :/. He (19 M) definitely apologized to me a lot and  acknowledged what he’s (19 M) done was wrong, he (19 M) knows now that this is a challenge on me (21 F). 
I'm (21 F)still processing this so any advice is nice and please we've been together for almost 3 years breaking it off is really hard because I'm (21 F) super sensitive and although it’s wrong and messed up, I (21 F) still wanna work on this relationship, just please nothing rude he’s (19 M) a nice guy I just think he (19 M) didn’t know it was wrong he (19 M) says “everybody does it” he’s (19 M) just a little stupid in common sense.  I’m (21 F) just like in shock like, damn this just happened. Because he (19 M) was the last person I’d (21 F)expect to even be such a secret perverted self and he (19 M) mentioned liken he (19 M) keeps it a secret because he (19 M) doesn’t wanna be perceived as that kind of guy. It really has changed my view on him (19 M) and ofc I (21 F) told him (19 M) even tho I’m (21 F) staying my trust level is very low and he (19 M) has to work on himself (19 M) better and this relationship to earn it back. I (21 F) just want any advice or like if someone has went thru the same thing how did y’all deal with it, how do you cope with it. I (21 F) know it’s messed up but I’m (21 F) really trusting my judgement on him (19 M) to be better.",0,I’m a 21 yr old female and my partner is a 19 yr old male almost turning 20.

I'm anxious, working on becoming secure and have been to therapy and im very self aware and continue to work on myself at any opportunity.  This is one of those times and I'd appreciate some help. 

We've been together for 4 months and I love being with him though I do wonder if his feelings are as strong as mine.  We went out at the weekend which was a good night and we were all tipsy.  We got onto a subject of guessing peoples professions and there was a guy sat behind us with his girlfriend.  My friend mentioned he looked like an accountant, my boyfriend made a comment that he was ""punching"".  This upset me a bit but I didnt make it known and stepped out for 5 minutes.  It made me feel inadequate, not enough and unattractive because he clearly noticed her to make such a comment. 

The next day we spoke about it and I explained how it made me feel and all was sorted but my boyfriend got on the subject of sometimes not hearing from me all day and asked if I was trying to ""send a message"" or if it was a secure day.  I said the days he doesnt hear from me properly are days where I have nothing interesting to say or I'm really busy but ill make more of an effort if it bothers him. He said it doesn't  

Today, I snuck to the toilet in work to give him a quick text to let him know I was thinking about him, I didnt do this because of our conversation, I did it because I wanted to text him and didnt have the conversation in mind.

He said it was cute that I snuck out but don't feel the need to because ""I dont worry when I dont hear from you"".  Im not really sure how to take this and im not sure how to ask without it coming across as insecure.  My first initial response is ""oh ok, so you don't care if you hear from me?"" But I know how bad that sounds, so I'd really appreciate insight on how I should take this and how best to ask for clarification in a secure way?

I have met ""M's"" immediate family and as far as i can tell they like me especially his mom and sister. They have their suspicions of us dating but he always denies it it got to the point his dad asked if we where friends with benefits. ""M"" had told me they had told him around the first month we where dating that as long as he was honest they would be okay with us dating but he still denied it. ""M"" also has told none if his current friends about me which makes me feel hidden. I know for a fact it's not because he has another girlfriend or anything of that sort. ""M"" had also failed to mention that he was moving across the country for college until ""M"" told me he wasn't allowed to date. That is one of the reasons his parents don't want him dating but I've been looking for a excuse to leave this terrible state so he is my excuse. We will be living separately as he will be living at the dorms and i will be in a apartment right across the state border. The main reason i'm so upset about being hidden from his friends and family is because i feel like i am hiding a piece of myself and i worked hard to come out of my shell.

""M"" and i grew up very different his parents are in the upper middle class with lots if family members and I grew up in poverty with just my grandma. I have worked for everything i have while ""M"" was handed everything he has. He doesn't understand i cant just put hundreds of dollars away when i get paid i make 12.50/hr and only work 30 hrs a week so i don't make a bunch of money. I'm planning on getting a second job soon i've just been waiting until i get my license. ""M"" is really a great boyfriend as he loves me for who i am and has made me so much more confident in myself. He has also been teaching me how to drive. The negatives and positives are equal which is why im so conflicted on what to do.


I am genuinely so sorry if none of this makes sense i dropped out before my freshman year and never really paid attention in school i also have dyslexia. If its to confusing i will just delete it.

relationship_advice,"I have been with her for 4 months. Things have been relatively great but sexually I always felt like something was off. She is somewhat of a prude... Or so I thought. When we have sex all she does is let me play with her and then get on top of her. Rarely she will get on top and always complains about how being on top tires her. She doesn't like any other position besised missianory. 

She does not like to give head, she says she's never done it for anyone, which I find hard to believe. At the same time, she loves getting eaten out. I don't mind doing it for her but the fact that she doesn't want to do it for me has built up resentment and now I don't so it anymore. 

Overall, sex with her has becoming boring and tiring to me. It's almost like a chore I have to do but don't truly enjoy. Lately she been complaining about it and I try to bring the issues to her... She just cry and claim I don't love her anymore and that I'll cheat with someone else because she doesn't do the things I want. 

Last night we were talking about sex, and she told she wished I was more aggressive in bed. She wish I would be more dominant and tell her what to do. I don't take offense in what she says because I am confident in my sexual abilities and I know I can be dominant. But what baffles me is the fact that she is the most uninteresting sexual I have ever had and it feels like she again just want to lay there and let me do all the work while getting nothing in return besides a subpar ejaculation.

relationship_advice,"So me (22F) and my fiancé (27M) will be getting married in 2025. We come fron different countries and the people/friends we are still closest to today respectively are the friends we made back in high school. I understand that in the US the groom will usually have a best man and the bride will have a maid of honour. In my country we have so-called ""witnesses"" that need to sign the legal document that states that a couple is married now. The witnesses will normally be the people who are closest to the bride and groom, the couple will thus usually be picking their best friends or a sibling. Now, I am having trouble to pick a witness as I feel equally close to all of my female friends and do want them all to be present at my wedding without anyone feeling like they should've been picked for the role of the witness.

I do also have a female best friend since childhood that I do consider to be the sister I never had but because of a recent moral argument that we had about her willingly being an affair partner to a married man I do not want her to be the witness to my own marriage. This is a matter of principle for me, apart from a lot of other issues that are of course entailed by this topic, the symbolism of having a person who is secretly breaking up a marriage be my witness does absolutely not sit right with me.

Because of all of this I have decided to make my witness a male one, namely my other best friend of nearly 7 years who also happens to be my ex-boyfriend. We have been each other's first love but eventually realised that we would never work as a romantic couple in the long run because of various reasons I won't go into now and broke up on very good terms. We have always shared the same friend group and still do and nothing's ever been awkward for anyone after our breakup. He has been one of the first people to learn about my engagement and has been open and welcoming towards my fiancé from the start, which has not been true for the rest of my friends who have been rather sceptical of this relationship as they had never met him in person before (different countries and we met while living abroad). I love him like my own brother now and am grateful for his advice, insight and encouragement and am incredibly lucky to be able to call him my friend. 

Now, a couple of people have raised their concerns that a) since I am a woman it's unusual for me to have a best man and not a maid of honour and b) it is even weirder that we used to date. I absolutely do not want people to attend my wedding and talk about my choice of witness as being a weird one and spend the day talking about this behind our backs. Now, I know that this is not what everybody else does but would it really be that inappropriate to make my male best friend my best man/witness because we dated when we were teenagers?",0,"I (22F) want my male best friend/ex-boyfriend (22M) to be my best man, is this inappropriate?",r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8868687,1682519412,0,1682519430,1682519431,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,16,545

relationship_advice,"I broke up with my ex-girlfriend a year ago. We were together 1,5 years. One Year of that time was a distant relationship.

In the end we fought about nearly everything, I was unhappy because of stress and missing communication and the fact that I had found a new apartment near my new job, but that would have meant to live again in long distance. During our first year together, we developed an unhealthy communication pattern where we got to know each and every step of one another. Mostly my fault, I think. She was my first girlfriend. And I didn't know better.   
I am a very jealous person as well, and the fact that she wanted to continue to be friends with her only known friend and ex was hard to deal with. That took its fair share to the situation.

I got my new apartment nearly 150 km away from her. Despite that, I tried to be at her place as often as I could. When I asked her to come to my place sometimes she did not answer and nothing happened, 9 months passed, and she was only 3 times at my place for not more than 2 days each. 2 of the 3 times i kind of forced her to my. That did not felt right, it sucked.

I broke up. The way I did was really awful. I broke the heart of my ex-girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

9 months later...  
I had found new friends at my place and did great at work, but I could not get over her. I traveled and visited cities with my new friends, but was not able to get over her. Furthermore, I received a letter from her 6 months after the breakup, where she stated that she was still in love with me and how great the time was.   
I used the time to reconsider the relationship with her. I  thought about myself and what I want in my life. 3 Months after the letter, I got enough courage to get into contact with her again. And we meet up 3 times now in a timespan of 2 months. 

We talked about our faults and what happened in the time between breakup and now. I apologized for the way I ended things and she accepted. She was happy to see me gain, and after really long talks (6h+) I felt that a relationship was on the horizon. I asked her if she would be able to try it again with me. She said that she was jealous of the time I had, that I cleared my mind and was able to enjoy the last month with my friends. She said that she was not able to be happy, that she loves me and thought that she would never see me again. She is afraid that I could leave her again. Her heart says YES, but her mind says NO.

I asked how much time she needs, and she didn't know. She wants the time that I had with my friends. 

I said that if she does not know how much time she needs and if she wants the time that I had with my friends, free from grief and sadness, that I would cut the contact again, and she can decide and reach out to me when she feels like it. If I am free then, we could maybe be together again.  
I said that I am not able to be just friends with her.

I don't know if I acted right in that situation, and if I am  blackmailing her in any way.

relationship_advice,"My(32F) situationship (31M) got into a fight last night, as we do very often. We’ve been on and off for five years. We are long distance the past couple years or so (and basically exclusive,) but he has been here visiting. A few days ago we had a falling out, I don’t even remember why, but he ended up saying he would just come out and see me and then we’d be done after. I ended up telling him I didn’t want to see him if that was just going to be it. It got very dramatic. He went and started trying to hook up with other girls, ended up hanging out with one and “making out and flirting.” Something very similar happened last time with the same girl. Well, we ended up talking again, with him saying he misses me, and that he only did that because I made him feel rejected. We ended up hanging out a couple days last week, and then he came over night before last to hang out as well. We had a good day yesterday, but whenever he would get on his phone I would get really paranoid about who he was texting, so finally last night I asked to see his phone. I looked at his messages between him and the other women. It honestly was not nearly as bad as I was expecting, and I would have been able to go on with the night without much issue. I must add that we do have a history of trust issues, and he has gone through my phone numerous times just to check up on me, and I have freely allowed that, as I understand. Well, when I was looking through his stuff, he asked to see mine. I said fine. This man starts to go through everything very thoroughly. All he finds is that I have multiple accounts(emails, social media, etc, which has been the case for basically years,) as well as some authenticators for work,) and then that I have taken tons of screenshots of his Twitter account. He’s seen that I screenshot his reddit in the past, and I’ve admitted to stalking him several times. I admit my taking pics has gotten a little crazier the past few months, and it’s a habit I started with my previous ex when stuff got really bad. It’s kind of like if I track everything it could be like potential evidence of something in the future. I admit it isn’t healthy. I feel like this situation is very unhealthy, and I have told him I am unhappy, that the current state of things is bad for me, I see myself getting worse, I feel like often I’m feeling retraumatized from things from my past, etc. I’ve asked him to go to therapy with me but after a few sessions, he felt as if the therapist was just expecting him to do things he wasn’t comfortable with, and that’s I wasn’t listening about him not wanting me to “nag” him anymore, so he stopped going.   

He was really freaked out about all of the pictures, and says he like I’m going to use it to blackmail him one day, that he doesn’t trust me and that having so many accounts is sneaky. Now as creepy as I might be, I have never been the type to be vindictive. He on the other hand has threatened me with stuff, although hasn’t really done anything. I tried explaining to him last night  why I was doing it but he wouldn’t really discuss it with me. Once he was finished going through everything he just made me feel really judged and embarrassed and exposed. I was very upset and he just seemed really checked out. He told me he’d talk to me while I gave him a massage, so I did. He told me it was all fine and he understood. He had me give him a blowjob, and then I just sat there still feeling shaky. He said he was going for a smoke, but instead went to eat snacks and watch his phone. After a few minutes of this I went into the room pissed off at his lack of concern towards me. He just acted clueless, aloof, etc. I grew very emotional. I told him he was acting uncaring and distant and hurtful, and continued to smoke weed. I got so pissed and he told me we were done. I proceeded to cry and beg him to just connect with me but he refused and blamed me for ruining a perfectly good evening, etc. He still was upset about the pictures and everything as well. He remained distant with no real resolution before we finally fell asleep. I asked him if we were really done, and he just told me he was going to sleep but that I could cuddle him and here we are.",0,My 32F situationship 31M got into a fight over my excessive screenshots and being too needy,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8868659,1682519019,0,1682519034,1682519034,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,16,822

relationship_advice,"So a little background: he is my first boyfriend but I am his 4th gf. We have been “together” for about a year and two months. 9/14 of those months have been long distance due to him moving out of the state. 

When we were together in person, I had often thought of breaking up with him. Mainly because we have values and morals that don’t align and I put those above my attraction for another person. 

For example: he doesn’t plan on living past 50, and I think 50 is too young to die. I respect animals and nature, he jokes about hitting birds with tennis rackets. He is NOT emotionally available… he’s definitely improved since we were together but I try and communicate things with him and it’s like I am walking him through how to feel . (Like I’ll be upset and he will be like “sorry I will make sure not to do that” when I want him to say more than “sorry” and even explain his side of the situation.)

But with him being my first boyfriend, I thought maybe I had to wait it out and see if things change because I honestly think I have commitment issue or just really high standards. I have talked to others and they told me it sounds like I’m looking for excuses. I also know he loves me so much and i feel like it would destroy him for me to break up with him. 

Anyways, here’s the stuck part: we are going on a cruise with his family this summer. He had paid like 20% of my part as I am in school. I know that we see each other in person again, I’ll be in that infatuation stage, but once I don’t see him for another two months I know I will feel the exact way I am feeling now.

I don’t know what to do.

I feel god awful and sorry this is a rambling mess. I have been dating my boyfriend for 3 years; we’ve lived together for 2 years. I love him deeply and we have been building a future together. He is great, always so kind he provides, dose the dishes , takes out the trash and is understanding of my disorders (autism, bipolar disorder, anxiety and C-PTSD). My problems with him I feel aren’t that big of a deal. 

SO here’s my confession. I hate physical affection. I don’t kiss him, I don’t like cuddles, I don’t hug him and I tolerate sex. I feel so terrible about it he loves that stuff. He will ask for these things all the time and push me to try to get these things. He will grab my ass and i’ll get grumpy. Then it turns into a guilt trip thing where he gives the puppy eyes and I feel god awful.

We don’t get to spend much time together I work overnight and he works mornings. I’m going to school also. But I feel emotionally neglected we have not gone on a date in 3 years! but we did have a vacation for 4 days. We have deep conversations about once a week. But we don’t spend time together he is always online with his friends while I am doing school.

I don’t know what to do I tell him that these things make me uncomfortable and he’ll say I understand and i’m sorry with big puppy eyes/moping. But then it happens over and over again.

relationship_advice,"I 25F have been best friends with my friend 25F since we were 12. We have been through literally everything together, including a lot of trauma on both ends. Last year, she got pregnant with her second child, but it’s her first with her long term boyfriend and she was super excited. I went with her to take the test. Unfortunately, at about 9 weeks the baby had no heartbeat and she was told she’d have to take pills to expel the baby from her since it wasn’t coming out on its own. When she told me the news we cried together and I told her to let me know what she needs and I’d be there. After that she was distant but I understood as she was going through something awful and was taking time with her family. I would text her periodically just to check in but would talk about random things not related to the miscarriage and she would give one word answers or not reply at all. Once she even said she’s been keeping to herself so I figured she needed space, especially since she never reached out and barely responded to me. 
Now I’m being accused of being a bad friend because I didn’t show up at her house unannounced (something I’ve literally never done) like her other friend did and I should have known she needed me. I told her I thought I was giving her what she needed- space. Plus, I had a lot of my own issues and mental health battles going on (I did not mention this to her) so I did not have the capacity to be constantly reaching out, especially when it barely went answered. I learned later that she had to take 3 rounds of pills to get all of the remains out and had to go to the hospital because she almost went septic, all things she NEVER told me until now- almost an entire year later. We have the same therapist so we went to therapy to talk it out and I thought things were resolved but she’s been acting the same.

Any advice?

relationship_advice,"Hi guys, I could really use some help here ! On mobile, sorry for the formatting and English is not my first language, sorry for any mistake ! 


So I’ve been with my bf for a year and a half, but we have know each other and been friends for at least four years. We happily live together in our home country in Europe. 

My bf does finances for a small company, and they had to go to the US for 3 weeks to meet clients, find some place to produce their product, … 
He left 3 days ago (meaning he’s gone another 15 days at least), and since then I have been feeling so so depressed. I don’t want to eat, clean our appartement, see anyone. It might have something to do with him not being here, but also, it’s like an existential crisis for me. I’ve also been having some bad thoughts (nothing I will act on I promise). 

I realize that this is not normal and so I made an appointment with a therapist. I’ll be seeing her next week. I’m so glad I got to have an appointements that quickly. 

But I haven’t told my bf anything about my mental state. Or about me seeing a therapist next week. It is his first time in the US, I’m so happy he gets to go there, and I really don’t want to make him concerned or sad for me. 

I guess I need advice whether or not to tell him. On one hand, I want to be honest with him and I know that having his support would mean so much; however, if I tell him, he’ll have to worry and maybe he will spend too much effort talking to me and I will prevent him from enjoying his trip… 

Do you have any advice ? I really don’t want to hide things but I also want him to make the best out of his trip… thank you so much in advance

relationship_advice,"The title says it all. I’m not going to get into the specifics of the broken promise, but my girlfriend and I agreed that I would abide by this promise. Long story short, I made a mistake and broke her trust by not sticking to my word. For further knowledge, this has nothing to do with infidelity. That is against both of our morals, and I can say that with complete confidence. The issue at hand is that I did not stick to my word and it hurt her.

We had a very long few days this past weekend with long conversations. She feels so hurt that I did not stick to my word that she is very much considering ending things with me. We currently live together and are supposed to move into a new house together next month. 

Everything is up in the air and she doesn’t know if she wants to be with me at this point. 

I feel terrible that I did not stick to my word and broke her trust. I am taking it very hard. It is 100% on me and I am owning it fully. There are no excuses and I am not here to make any. I am taking complete ownership. I just want to do my best to steer the ship in the right direction.

It is pretty fresh and she typically takes longer than most people to process a situation. I like to tackle things head on and I am not a fan of being in limbo. But I understand that she is the one struggling, so I am doing my best to take it day by day.

Now, I am asking the thread their opinion on this scenario that is at hand. Next Monday she is flying across the country for work. It is a short trip and she will be back either Wednesday or Thursday. I am staying at home to watch the cat and take care of the house (she loves her cat more than anything in the world). My question is, should I take a flight to her work location across the country and surprise her at her hotel with something nice and then fly home the next day? I have a flexible enough work schedule that I could easily make it work. OR should I stay home and do business as usual?

There are pros and cons here. She could take it very well and be very happy that I would do something so out of my way for her. Or she could be like “why the hell did you fly all the way over here🙄”. 

At the end of the day, I love this woman endlessly. I truly would do anything for her and I want to get back on track, be the best human being I can be, and prove to her over time that I can and will always be a man of my word going forward.

I really appreciate anyone that gives me any feedback or opinions. I am open to any and all suggestions.

relationship_advice,"Tldr: he is a student, I have doubts if I should keep it going. 

I have been in a relationship with my bf officially, 3 months. Met him 6 months ago, started to be exclusive immediately at that point when I met him. 

We started talking about this relationship more and more seriously after he met my parents like one month ago. This is important to me because we are bound to religion, and I don’t want to cross the line. 

For the past one week or two, I feel like breaking up with him. But every time I say something about it, he would ask me to be patience. This feeling roots from how I am older, and already working.. I feel like I am rushing. I am the immature one. He wants to finish studies, he will finish in a year and half. which I can wait until then, but I don’t know if I could wait any longer than 3 years. 

I feel bad that I put him in this position. I wish I was 3,4 years younger. He is from different country, family comes from completely different background than me, I am bottom middle working class, he is… in a higher different level of working class, and different culture which scares me more. I have nothing much to offer for him besides this feeling. I feel shit sometimes because I am older than him. 

I am scared if I keep waiting for him, at the end, he would give up on me.. and see that I do have nothing much to offer. 

I asked him today, if he felt like he wanted to break up with me, and he said he did, sometimes. He didn’t want to waste my time waiting. But then it went away (the thought), and he wanted to make it work and leave it to god.

relationship_advice,"Hello all, 

So Ive been with this man for the last 4 almost 5 years this time. Previously we were together roughly 14 years ago for about 2 years and he had to go away for awhile. We first started our relationship back when we were just out of highschool and we ment everything to each other. I tried to stay with him throughout the time he needed to serve. I only lasted only 9 months. I could t do it. There were other factors that came about nothing personal but it just didn't work for us at that time in our lives. My sisters and mom still considered him as a brother and son in-law. And that extended with his family as well, his mom was my mom, and his brother was literally my best friend for multiple years to follow.
After he was out we talked here and there he was working regularly and living in a halfway house. Not because of drugs or drinking, it was apart of him coming back as a citizen. I had visited him at that half way house about 3 times while I was dating someone. I wanted to give him the support the best I could with being in a relationship. With that relationship I gave birth to one amazing boy. This person I'm talking about still understood why I had a child and has been the best and most understanding man I could ever think of. So prior when he just got out he visited at my place of employment about 3x a week for multiple months and at that time I was really fucked up. But he was still there for me and my son, the child he never helped conceive. We broke apart for about a year after that. Then my sister came home from Texas to finally move back home.. I was the person who picked her from the airport and brought her back to moms. I stayed for about two hours enjoyed her company and drove home. Not even 10 minutes I left her home I got a message from her saying that he was there. I literally missed the love of my life by just a few minutes. So my sister, him and I decided it was best to go get some food somewhere. We all meet at this restaurant and our song came on, we both looked at each other and said that we could try this again, and we did. We are now on year 4 almost 5 in October. But as of now he is working 1000 miles away from our home and we are going on 4 months this Sunday. I have no trust with him. I don't know how to do it anymore. So the first year of our recent time together I cheated and had sexual contact with my ex boyfriend and he hasn't been normal since, I know I fucked up. I would never think about doing anything like that to him again. Je is my person no questions. But Multiple women calling started calling him and asking for him to support them going through treatment. The only way I found out is because we would be out doing something like grocery shopping and then he would take a call and disappear for a short period. I let it go for about 5 times before I asked. And he told me it was a girl from a long time ago and he would call her when he was gone so she is looking for support. Later on I found out this was completely untrue. It was the woman that stayed with him in the halfway house. I don't know what to say from here because I feel like after I just typed this out, I shouldnt even go further with my explanations. 
So this girl actually was staying with him in his halfway house and she was with him and going strong. But he described it to me as a friend who lost a parent and was wasted all the time. I feel better and may ebelieve that now. So now we are on our 4th year together going on 5 in October. But he is working out of state and has been gone for 4 months this Sunday. He has been very weird with his time, and can't explain much he is but he is very short. I drove down about a month ago to visit with my son and he was very happy and we all enjoyed our time together. We also bought a camper and accomplished so much being there with him. But now he is staying at his ex girlfriends house (she has a boyfriend now, he is my boyfriend's rebound to say the least). But I've had trust issues with him for the last year between paying for illicit videos, talking and saying things to woman he shouldn't be saying; And on top of it he won't give me that attention and I've brought it up so many times I can't even count... 

So my issue is that he is now staying in this house with the woman he dated just prior to me. He isn't his ""normal self"" going to bed early like 9pm when he has always gone to bed at midnight. So this woman will send me snaps just prior to him calling me to say goodnight,  but with her saying she is going to bed too at the same time... Then this morning he was supposed to have work. And I called him about 730-745a trying to wake him since he was supposed to be onsite at work around 6am. Thinking that he was late and needed a call since he told me the night prior that he has work. (I'm out of state and not with him.) But he never answered. And I saw that she was on Facebook and Instagram just a few minutes after I tried to call and wake him up. And from my understanding from her telling me she usually sleeps till 10-11am. So that makes me think she was in bed with him and woke up from me calling him. Then on top of that two days ago he sent me a bathroom mirror picture and there was a makeup bag and toothbrush bag, I asked him about it and he said it's beeen there for the past two weeks.. but this is my first time seeing this. I contacted the woman and she said it's hers and she had to leave in a hurry and count take it. What woman leaves her make-up bag and toothbrush when you are going to live 3 states away for at least 4 months. So he is still going to bed when she sends me videos of he in her room or living room sleeping and he sends; ne goodnight messages or call at the same time. I'm in a total mind fuck with this. And him and I just talked about all of this for 6 hrs non stop  two days ago. I don't believe it. Oh and he didn't feel like he need to tell me that she has been there since the day we talked about our relationship and how it's going to work for that 6hrs. I'm at a total loss for words and what I should do and who I should believe. I feel like I'm going crazy. But he literally won't even come home. I've tried to buv multiple plane tickets for him for  just one for a few days and he declined it.

What do I do?
Is it worth my fight? I feel like I'm completely losing myself trying to make this work. Does he even care? I feel so disgusted, I know this isn't a normal relationship. But I'm to the point myself that I want to give up. 
In the past year I've cought him over 7 times. And that's just what I've cought him doing. He completely denies everything unless I have proof. I'm just done. I'm almost 35, I want a real boyfriend. Fuck I want to be married and be happy and have some type of eternal love with my best friend. But right now, that few months I feel like no matter what I'll never get it.

It's my first kinda-dating relationship with this guy. We only just finished the talking stage and have been going on dates and hangout with eachother's friends for a month now. 

However, I think this won't happen anymore. It was 2 days ago when we hooked up at a gathering. After about 15 seconds in, I started picking up on some pieces that I'm pretty sure were his tonsil stones. So, I felt it immediately but didn't immediately think that. Until I opened my eyes and saw that his eyes were already open, then we paused, so from moving the pieces around to straight up swallowing the chunks. I kinda made a face, I think? I can't remember. I hope that made sense.

Anyways, it was so awkward! I think he knew. He immediately said he was gonna go grab another drink so he left. I didn't see him again for the rest of the night, because apparently his parents told him to get home earlier, what he said when I texted him. 

We have not talked or seen eachother since, even though we are always on campus at the same time. It seems he has been avoiding me. I haven't checked up on him either since that night. 

Tbh, I don't know how to feel. I was really disgusted and also disappointed that night. He's such a great guy and we were doing so well. Not sure if this is me justifying it or not but I've grown to think it's okay, since I also have tonsil stones that comes out sometimes when I gargle, and so it's just a really weird accident that happened? 

I mean, is it normal? Has this happened to anyone else? Should I be more disgusted? 

Not sure how I feel. I mean it's a new relationship. But it seems like a promising one. I honestly don't know. 

No matter what, I would still like to make him feel better about the whole situation though.

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two and a half years. We’ve been doing really well lately, and have plans for the summer. 

About a month ago, we were fighting a lot. He thought he was going to break up with me, so he tried looking for other women to date. He followed a bunch of women, and hit them up to see if something could work out. Meanwhile, I had no idea that we were going to break up. 

I found out a week later. He apologized and said he never met up with any of those girls and that he would be better. I asked about one girl in particular, and he said that with that ONE person, he actually wasn’t looking to date her. He was just catching up with an old family friend. 

Yesterday, I found out that he met up with old family friend. They walked around together, talking for over two hours in the middle of the night. He said nothing physical happened, but I still am hurt by this potentially being emotional cheating. He said that she likes him, so they met up. He said that he found her attractive and funny, but ultimately stayed with me. 

He says it isn’t cheating because we’ve been doing so well lately and he ghosted the family friend. He said the past is in the past and thinks I’m ridiculous for being upset about this.

relationship_advice,"I don’t even know how to begin.

For starters I guess I need to say I myself I’m bisexual. I’m attracted to women and men and maybe in between too. I’m monogamous and I’ve been married for almost ten years. We have a 5 year old child together. 

For the past several years our sex life has been worsening. Going down in frequency, even before I got pregnant.  I’ve always been the one who initiates.

I recently came back from a trip and when I was emptying the toilet trash I found a condom in a wrapper. I had emptied the bathroom trash before I left so I definitely found this odd, to say the least.

I haven’t had a chance to address it and I don’t want to make an accusation… so I did something probably worse and invaded his privacy, looking through his phone. 

Well, in it I found a flickr app and he has an account under a different name and over 30k pictures of sexually explicit nature favorited. The photos are mostly of cross dressing men (as per the album description) in various S&amp;M situations, and some of them just wearing office clothes and boots.

He’s always been into S&amp;M as well as sexy office clothes and boots and I’ve always known he saves photos but it used to be of women. 

As I mentioned before, I myself find all genders attractive. So I’m not looking down upon this in a homophobic way.

But I do feel shocked at this part of him I didn’t know and to be honest I’m disturbed by some of the S&amp;M content (not judging just not my personal preference and something I’ve never felt comfortable participating in)

I’m not sure what to do. I know I opened Pandora’s box, but I’m still wondering about the condom and now I’m wondering if this is an expansion of his sexual proclivities or an adjustment to his preferences.

We haven’t had sex in two months, not for lack of my trying and I had been feeling like he wasn’t attracted to me anymore. 

Not sure what to do or how to feel. I know I was in the wrong for looking through his phone rather than simply confronting him, but I did it and now I’m here.

I love him but he hates his job and I feel like it’s affecting me. He works a seasonal job and is laid off for the winter months. He just started the job again and is already telling me how much he hates it, especially his coworkers. He tells me he wants to work with his mom doing cleaning jobs. I told him to go for it but he would have to make a decent amount of money so that we can maintain living on our own. He does not want to do any other job than cleaning. I should also mention that he smokes weed everyday and plays video games non stop. I have a really good job and went to college and got my degree, he has no formal training in anything and does not want to go to school or a trades school. He has been this way about every job he’s had since we’ve been together, I initially thought it was his first job but the same issue reoccurs.

relationship_advice,"I know some people might still think Gloria is a gold digger. I don't, and for the sake of this post, let's assume she isn't. We can also see that at the start of the series how Jay was an old–school homophobic, sexiest, and occasionally racist (mostly toward Gloria's culture). He also didn't like Manny. On the other hand, she is definitely an intelligent, strong, and beautiful woman who can get the heart of any man she wants. She also does seem to have high standard, well communicate what she thinks is right, and act as a strong glue to hold the Pritchett family together, even helps Jay to improve himself.

As the series goes, Jay definitely changes for the better and the Pritchett family becomes more loving and understanding toward each other. This is where my questions come:

1. With all of the toxic viewpoints he innitially had, **how did Gloria know he was a good man to marry?** Or did she know that at all? Because if she didn't believe he was a good man and indeed married him for his wealth, she wouldn't be so open to discuss/ argue her standards with him. But even if she could see him as a good man at heart, would a good man be toxic toward other sexualities and cultural differences?
2. **How did she know he would change for the better? I.e. what made her continue staying with him and believing he would change/ she could change him?** Because at the beginning of the series, with all of those viewpoints, he also wasn't so kind toward her child at all, the child who is the closest and dearest to her.
3. **What's the core trait Jay has that made Gloria believes he's a good man at heart?**

relationship_advice,"Hi, you can call me NoPenta, and I've been struggling with retroactive jealousy for about 1.5 years now. A week prior to my first date with my current girlfriend, she had a second hook-up with her friend, who is also her sister's boyfriend's roommate. They had their first hook-up two months prior to the second. He's a good-looking guy, and I've met him twice now, and he seems like a generally chill person. She told me about her experience with him after we had been dating for about three weeks. At first, it didn't bother me much, but the more I fell in love with her, the more it started to bother me, especially since I got to know him. I keep imagining what happened between them and asking irrelevant questions that I know won't help, but I can't seem to shake the thoughts. I now know stupid details like his penis size and other irrelevant things. It can bother me for weeks or even months in a row, and I can't seem to get rid of the thoughts of them being intimate together. Her other hook-ups bother me less since I don't know those guys, but they still bother me slightly. However, this specific hook-up bothers me the most because this person will always be a part of my life. I've caught myself snooping around their social media and constantly comparing myself to him in terms of looks.

I know the past is the past, and I've had my own past as well. I also know that if things hadn't happened the way they did, there's a chance our paths wouldn't have crossed at all. But I can't rationalise my thoughts. I know she didn't do anything wrong, and it's my problem that I need to deal with, but I just haven't found a solution yet.

I love my girlfriend, and she's been very understanding and supportive of the whole situation, providing me with a lot of reassurance. However, the thoughts won't go away. I just feel hatred, knowing that they've seen and felt each other's bodies the same way I have.

Does anyone know what I should do in this situation, or how I can get a grip on my thoughts? Thank you in advance. How can I (24M) stop obsessing over my girlfriend's (23F) hook-ups?

relationship_advice,"So basically, we have been dating for about 5 months but knew each-other for a year before dating. I’ve always been one of them people to get attached to people extremely fast and what-not, so I feel like we got into this relationship faster than we should’ve because although we knew each-other for a year before we were sortve more acquaintances rather than friends, and we’re only talking more about 3 months before we started dating. So anyways the other day him and I got into a bit of an argument because he made this ‘joke’ which was actually quite insulting, Ik he didn’t mean it but still I got quite upset and he was like ‘why are you so sensitive’ I said ‘what? You just said (what he said), he then said ‘you’re always like this, you’re too sensitive. I can’t hang around girls because you’ll get jealous, you always overreact and overthink about everything, you’re so clingy, needy and you make everything revolve around this relationship, I need a break’ so of course hearing that he wanted a break I was extremely upset at this point and started crying. He then said ‘I don’t know why you’re crying over the truth?’ I asked him to give me an example of literally any of them things I have done and he brought up the fact that I always wanna hold hands or hug, or the fact that I’ll bring up problems from arguments we have had ages ago. But in all of them arguments he just says sorry and never does anything to actually resolve the problem, I told him this and he said ‘I’m always the one saying sorry why do I have to fix every single problem’ and then he brought up the jealous problems, I told him I don’t care that he has women as friends but I found a couple of text messages like playfully teasing one of his female friends, I was upset because he does that to me too and yk, I’m his girlfriend for a reason so he doesn’t treat me the same as every other girl, but that’s beside the point he called said some more, called me manipulative and then left. I’ve been reflecting on all of the things I’ve done and I’m starting to think maybe I am the problem. I’m one of them people who need comfort, and overthink alot (I have really terrible anxiety and he knows this) , I often think he’s going to leave me and/or cheat on me (never have I accused him of cheating on me just had thoughts about it) and as for the manipulative part, I honestly don’t know if I am because I have seen a few texts where I say things like ‘ remember when you did this and that’ ‘you’re such a bad boyfriend’ ‘maybe if you were more like (exes name)’ and stuff, I really don’t mean to do it if that even is manipulation. I often will remember something wrong he had done and randomly get upset about it and bring it up because all the time , we will have an argument and as I said he will say sorry and not actually fix the problem which is why I’m upset because he doesn’t understand I actually need a solution because it feels like that problem is still there. This happens in all my relationships, I also am one of them people with no patience and I find myself blaming every problem on him. Like If I’ve had a bad day I take it out on him which isn’t intentional but it just comes out.

relationship_advice,"  

Last night I brought up that I believe 5 years is more than enough time for dating, last year October was our 3rd year anniversary. We talk about getting married and starting a family all the time in great detail, (how many kids, discipline, finances, wedding colours, what season the wedding will be etc.). In addition, I have discontinued my birth control because we are planned to start a family soon. Even though we are both starting off in our careers, he has had 2 raises and is due for another one after he gets admitted this year and I’ll be due for a raise as well after I graduate this year as well. He also made partner at a Labour consultancy and mentioned that money wouldn’t be a problem soon.

I thought with all of the above 5 years was a reasonable timeline to set, but he reacted very unexpectedly. At first he said I didn’t have a right to give him a time limit to propose, this really took me back, but maybe I worded it the wrong way and hurt his feelings.. idk

I said I just thought it’s a reasonable timeline to set, just something to work towards together, as we had been talking so much about the future. He then said he could propose to me in two months but “ I wasn’t ready for marriage” and when I was ready, he would propose. This absolutely pissed me off because it didn’t make sense, I was ready to be the mother of his child but not his wife. I was livid, I asked him to explain what he meant by that and he said he was wasn’t serious about he said. I completely shut down and stopped talking for the rest of the time I was at his place.

On the drive back to my place I asked him why he could make a timeline for having a baby but not marriage. He had been the one to suggest we start a family soon and I had agreed because I wanted too as well. He said he still had to build a foundation first and he “wouldn’t feel right to go to my dad at this point” so he wasn’t ready, I said we could do that together, with two incomes, we won’t be in the same place we are now in two or three years. When I asked what is a reasonable timeline for him, he said he doesn’t know, he’s under a lot of pressure and he doesn’t need this in addition. I said again how there’s no way he can be ready to have a child if he can’t handle any additional pressure and we should start considering contraceptives in that case. He then said I can’t just be making those kinds of decisions, but he stands with what he said about not being ready and I can do “whatever I want with that info” (I assume he meant I could leave the relationship if I wanted) 

It was heated conversation; I didn’t speak much because I was second guessing myself. Was I being unreasonable with that request, how can I covey that it wasn’t a demand, or is this something I should really worry about. It just doesn’t sit right with me that he wants to get me pregnant but isn’t even thinking about when he wants to marry me. I'm so confused.

relationship_advice,"Hello,

I wanted to say that my relationship with my girlfriend wasn't the best. We would argue a lot and talk and make up. The last time we did this, we made up and we both promised to improve. She said that I'm giving her less attention and not like in the beginning of our relationship. I agreed and explained why but said I would work on it. We went on a date (dinner + movie) and I made plans with her for more dates. 

In these weeks she would play online games with her friends a lot. So I didn't understand why she say I gave her less attention when I can't even talk to her because she is in call with her friends for almost the entire day.

All of the sudden (for me) she said she doesn't feel sexually attracted to me anymore and asked if I could move in with my mother for her to have some space and think this through. It was hard for me but I accepted it and moved to my mother with all my clothes and belongings.

After a couple of days she said she made her mind up and she wanted to break up. I asked her many times if she could re think this and if we could fix this together. She said multiple time that it isnt possible and I respected her discision.

After a day she messaged me 'My heart says the give you another chance, but my brain already says its doomed' or 'I almost wanted to ask you if you could come over'.

I was confused, angry and hurt. Was she playing games with me? She kept asking that she is feeling bad and I could come over. So I want there a couple of times and at the last visit she said that when we broke up, she got feeling for a friend of hers because he listened to her and was at her side when I wasn't. She wanted to go further with him and he agreed the same but they didnt last after a couple of days because he didnt want to message her more or call her.

Now I'm highly skeptical and my trust is gone. I said that im going to think over this if I want to start slowly. I asked her if I could see the conversation and she said that she doesnt want to hurt me and would be weird. She also said she deleted the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I strange for wanting to see the conversation? I want to see at what they said to each other and on what time. What if she did this while we where in a relationship and when it became serious she dumped me so she could get with him? And when he chickened out afterwards she wants me back? There are so many question in my head and if I ask it to her the answers dont make sence..........

relationship_advice,"Taking a break

Me (m22) and my partner (f22) of 3 and a half years have decided to take a limited/no contact break from each other, but still staying committed to each other and not seeing anyone else. This is because she hasn’t been feeling the best for a while now, not about the relationship but in regards to her self love and learning to be happy without having to rely on me. There are days where she isn’t happy at all but feels that she has to do her best to provide some energy towards the relationship, to be fair I don’t make it any easier, I’m in love with this girl and am insecure that she would leave for someone better (I am working on it still and have gotten a lot better). She feels the best way for her to regain her independent happiness is to step away from the relationship for the moment and just find her self love again, without seeing other people of course. I’m a wreck because she was my everything and I hate to see her like this, and I love her so so much so If she sees it as the only way to get through this I have to see it through to give our relationship the best chance of blossoming again. 

Has anyone been through this and what’s the best way to deal with no contact? 

I also don’t know how long it’ll last.",0,"22M and 22F, taking a break in the relationship",r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8868332,1682514982,0,1682515005,1682515005,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,9,245

relationship_advice,"Hey guys bit of context... I (23M) have been in NC with my ex (21F) for about 5 months now. Ended pretty amicably although I chased a lot after we ended and it became toxic. I eventually cut her off because I needed to heal and she just ended up taking my kindness and attention for granted while partying and dating around.

Anyway fast forward to now and I'm doing much better. I reactivate my Instagram last week after being off it for 6 months to heal. I realise I still had my ex on it but didn't care whether I still followed her or not. Anyway, few days after I reactivate it she removes me suddenly, and then removes me on TikTok a day later, after liking one of my posts a few weeks ago? And she liked my mum's IG post yesterday, a few hours after removing me. She also made her IG account private when it's always been public since the day we started dating (5 years ago).

I don't get it considering the last few things I said to her were wishing her well and explaining that I needed to heal. Is she mad at me for moving on? Is she trying to get a reaction out of me playing these mind games? And no I'm not going to reach out, but I'll be honest it did make me think hence why I am on here asking this... what do you guys think?",0,My (23M) Ex (22F) Suddenly Unfollowed Me Out Of Nowhere?,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8868263,1682514251,0,1682514261,1682514262,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,10,247

relationship_advice,"My partner (M30) and I (F28) have been together for 10 years and I'm currently 14w pregnant with our first child.

About a week ago, he revealed that he's been feeling depressed and anxious and that it has really began to affect him. I, of course, asked him what was wrong? He said he just had a lot on his mind all at once and just didn't know how to deal with it all. I offered him my support and encouraged him to seek counseling in hopes a therapist might provide clarity.

At the time I thought I understood why he could be possibility feeling this way as major life events were happening all at once: we are in the process of moving in with his parents to save money for a house, he hasn't been able to secure a job in our new city, he's worried about our finances during this transition, his self esteem has been low as he's unhappy with his weight and appearance, and we are having a baby (planned). Who wouldn't be stressed and overwhelmed, right??

Well, while he agreed that those factors contributed to his depression he mentioned that our relationship and his feelings within our relationship was also a huge part. I was shocked because everything seemed fine to me. Hell, we planned on having a BABY earlier this year! I, of course, asked him to elaborate and he basically wasn't sure if he's with me because he truly loves me or because he got too comfortable and I was his safe zone for all these years. He said it was about 6 months ago where this internal conflict began. He confessed that during that time a girl came up to him at a restaurant during his lunch and asked for his number. He gave it to her. He says the conversation was a generic getting to know each other and that he ended their conversation shortly after as he knew it wasn't right. He says he was surprised that another girl was interested in him and that he liked the attention, the validation and that it helped him boost his self-confidence. He then continues to admit that in our recent trip to Europe (about 4 months after the first girl) he was again at his lowest in terms of his self esteem and confidence and that one night during our trip he was on TikTok watching some TikToker that apparently does lives and dares or some shit. That he was just commenting on her live when she DM him. He says they began talking having only casual conversation but that suddenly he catches himself talking to this girl daily via texts, calls, video. That due to the time difference between Europe and US this happened only during work. He says there was no sexual or intimate conversations but that he would get jealous of guys commenting on her lives and that they would basically bicker about it as if they were a couple. That he started catching feelings in the way that we would be upset if she wouldn't message him, that once she told him how she liked him and enjoyed talking to him he realized it had gone to far that he didn't actually want to be with her nor was he practically interested in her per se but more in that attention she was giving him. Seeing that this had gone too far he ended their communication. According to him they stop speaking about 3 weeks ago.

And because of those two instances it made him doubt his love for me. He says, ""do I really love you if I did that so easily? But how can I not love you if we've been together for 10 years, engaged, and about to have a baby? Has my mentally changed and I no longer need a safe zone therefore I no longer want to be with you? Have I been with you all this time because there is love there or because I didn't have the courage and confidence to be on my own like I feel I do now?""

He then says ""if the therapist were to ask me if I want to stay in this relationship the honest answer would be: I don't know. What if I stay and continue to be unhappy and my depression worsens? But what if we separate and I realize that's not what I want but it's too late to have you back? What if this a personal problem more than a relationship problem and I would just do and feel the same with the next girl?""

This whole time I'm thinking... why the FUCK are we engaged, moving in with your parents, having a damn baby if you felt this way???? Had I known this was his feelings I wouldn't be pregnant with his child. 

I thanked him for telling me the truth, for being vulnerable and honest. I told him I understood the need of validation and attention especially after 10 years being with one person 24/7. We moved in together almost right away at 18 and 20 years old, we don't have friends, we don't have an independent social life. We have been constantly around each other everyday for 10 years. And I would be a liar if I said I didn't at one point crave the attention from others. But at the end of the day I valued what I had at home and didn't act on it.

The conversation ended with me telling him that obviously this information was hurtful and that it made everything way more complicated now because I can't live with my in laws now knowing my relationship is potentially falling apart. I don't have a new job yet or money to get my own place. I can't move far because we have a baby together now and obviously I want him to be involved. I have no one to talk to about this and I'm just stressed and overwhelmed.

I love him, but I don't want to be with someone who doesn't love me back. I would like to do couples counseling not necessarily for the sake of saving our relationship but to learn how to manage co-parenting with someone I'm still in love with but who has hurt me deeply.

I guess my question would be... how else do I navigate this complicated situation as my whole idea of my future has been suddendly shattered?

TLDR: I'm 14w pregnant and my partner recently confessed that he's unsure whether he truly loves me or not because he seeked the attention from 2 other women in the last 6 months. But, we are moving in with his parents in 1 week. I currently don't have a new job or money for my own place nor family or friends to rely on.

My best friend is a big fan of this cartoon character (let's call them X) and requested for me to buy a X toy for her when I went overseas. She has previously asked a few of her other friends to buy toys of this character for her as well and many have obliged. I was happy to do the same if I chanced upon the toys, but I wasn't intending to specifically search for it because my itinerary was quite packed.

Anyways, fast forward to when I was overseas. I found a snack of character X so I bought it first since my friend liked the cartoon. Additionally, I chanced upon 2 toys of the character but I wasn't sure if my friend already owned those designs, so I took pictures and sent them to her and asked if she wanted any of those. Unfortunately, she was sleeping when I sent the messages so I had left the shop by the time she replied. I said that if I happened to chance upon the toy she wanted, I would go get it.

When I returned from my trip, she texted me (note that she is a jokey person) - ""WHERE'S MY X"" and ""are you gonna join the list of people who went overseas but failed my mission"", referring to how she always asks people to buy toys of character X for her. I told her that I wasn't able to go back to the shop but I got another related item (the snack that I purchased). She then said, ""if it's good I'm gonna be disappointed"". I was quite miffed because (1) she didn't ask how my trip was, just where her gift was (even in a joking way) and (2) shitting on the gift I got. She guessed the snack I got and told me that someone else had got it for her before. And she told me, again in her joking manner, that she expected a toy and was ""manifesting it"" but she was going to ""take it off her manifesting board"".

I explained that I found quite a few gifts but didn't want to buy unless I knew she didn't have those. I also found a few other items on my trip but I didn't buy them because I felt they weren't suitable to her. She didn't reply those messages. Now that I look back on those messages, why did I have to defend myself and say that I actually looked for her stuff etc.? I feel that giving a gift is not an obligation and typically, I wouldn't even ask someone to buy a gift for me. Also, gift-giving is the last of my preferred love languages so I'm not very big on buying others gifts, but since my best friend asked, I was willing to oblige if it was convenient for me on vacation. I was just really annoyed by her responses but I didn't say anything because it has always been our dynamic where we just accept each other's flaws I guess? But maybe as her best friend I should call her out on this behaviour? I mean, she didn't even say thanks for at least trying and getting her a gift. I feel like not giving her the snack that I bought for her since she seemed pretty ungrateful for it and even said, jokingly, that she was disappointed that I didn't manage to get the toy.

relationship_advice,"Hello! English is not my first language and I haven’t written a lot of personal stuff in that language, apologies.

TL;DR: I(24f) went my my ex(34m)’s friend(25m), their friendship is ruined and I am confused.

&amp;#x200B;

For my masters last year, I had to choose a place to carry out an internship in. A laboratory accepted me for 2 months. Each intern is assigned a room, and I was sent to room 121, in which I met some other interns and PhD students, including my ex(34m)’s friend (25m).

My ex’s friend left for two weeks. My ex came to take his desk in room 121 for convenience reasons. We hit off immediately with a week of not-quite-dates, and I was really happy to see a man care this much about who I am. I started liking him. End of that week he admitted that he had a girlfriend of four years. We still ended up together.

He called his ex the day after and immediately told her they were over.

Fast forward a few days/weeks, my ex’s friend comes back from his trip to his birth country. No one told him what happened, and from what he told me, he’s planning on trying something with me. He learns the news from my ex.  

The second year of masters starts for me on September. I keep going to the laboratory because I really like the working ambiance there, my ex and my ex’s friend still work there. Things start to deteriorate. He wants me less and less physically and emotionally. He starts mentioning he feels bad for what he did to his ex.

We try to find activities because I really want to find something to bond over again. We start going climbing. My ex’s friend joins us on Sundays. It's fun. I sometimes go climbing only with my ex's friend since my ex is distancing.

Christmas comes by, and is a really bad time for me. Me ex goes back to his country, and doesn’t really communicate anymore. I start feeling anger.

I spend new years with a common friend of my ex’s friend and myself.  She tells me that, back in my first internship, my ex’s friend used to like me. She also says that he found somebody and he’s over it now. I ask her not to tell me more about this and not to tell him anything. She agrees.

On January, I start having lunch with my ex’s friend and some common friends since my ex is absent. On a Wednesday, my ex’s friend asks if anyone wants to come climbing, I say yes. We go together that evening, and I also tell him that my ex and I broke up. I’m really happy to tell him, but also nervous. We have a super fun session, he drives me home, and it’s the first time I’m really considering whether I like him or not.

At the same time, my ex comes back and he’s much better, the time away apparently helped and everything is going well at his job. I’m happy for him, but I stay really careful. Gradually, things deteriorate again and he becomes colder and more verbally aggressive. Over this lapse of time, we still have sex sometimes, and it gets less and less good as emotions become more and more complicated. Finally, I have enough of his aggressiveness and coldness, and I tell him that he’s making me upset and hurting me. He decides without explaining to me that he will cut all ties and push me away.  

Contact somewhat ceases (we still work in the same place).

I continue going climbing with my ex’s friend. We gradually become closer, pretty classic, and rope climbing is a really nice bonding activity anyway.  

We go out one night, my ex, my ex’s friend and some common friends. Everything is really nice, I have a strong friendship with my ex’s friend, the friend group helps me a lot and I don’t really feel so bad sitting at the same table as my ex now. When we leave, since I live really close by and I have a birthday present for him, I ask my ex if he’s like to come with me. He says no, he’ll walk 1hr with a friend to go home instead. A very similar situation will happened once or twice again before I understand it’s done for good. I'm hurt.

I continue my routine with my ex’s friend. I think a very mild flirt starts at some point, but we’re both too shy to really go for anything. Furthermore, he still has somebody. I know they are not a couple, but they still meet fairly often and have sex. I understand she probably likes him a lot.

In March, the friend group plans a ski trip. I know by now that I really like my ex’s friend. I agree to go, my ex doesn’t want to come, my ex’s friend and two more friends join. During that trip, I understand that he likes me the same way, even thought it’s too early for both of us to say anything.

The following week, I have problems with my bosses.  After a big talk, I go back to the office to find my ex’s friend waiting for me. He proposes we go out together. We have a really nice evening, and it’s now a hundred percent clear we want to be together. Still, we don’t kiss, and I understand he’s in the middle of breaking up with this previous relationship. The following day, some friends are going out and my ex, my ex’s friend and I join. I’m really not too happy my ex is here, I’m still deeply angry at him and I’d like to spend some time undisturbed with my ex’s friend. However, my ex leaves in the middle of the night, and my ex’s friend and I can be alone. We end up in my bed.

The evening of that day, my ex’s friend goes home, and my ex calls. He wants to talk about our relationship. I agree, and I explain to him that I met somebody else. He sounds really disappointed that we won’t be having sex anymore. He tries to guess who is the man I’m seeing, and I don’t want to tell him. His first guess is correct however.

One day later, we go climbing like we go every Sunday. Since we always went him, my ex’s friend and I, and I genuinely want to continue, I ask my ex if he wants to come. He says yes, and we have a normal session. Everybody pretends nothing happened. However, my ex is a smart man, and he understands something is off. In the afternoon, he texts me and we go for a coffee. We don’t really talk. Later, he calls me and we talk some more. I admit that the guy I’m seeing is my ex's friend. He comes by my place the same night to pick up all the stuff he forgot in my flat. He explains how angry he is that we tried to lead him on and make him believe nothing was going on. Then, he sits down and we talk. He calms down, gets very emotional.

He explains that if he pushed me away, it was to get me to make friends instead of sticking with him while he was hurting me.  He explains that while he was gone, he went to talk to his ex and ask her to judge him for what he did. He tells me that it helped him get over what he did and feel like he had a normal breakup. He explains that he feels much better now and ready to have a normal relationship with me.I’m quite thrown off-guard and this talk really touches me. I let him kiss me. We both genuinely missed each other and I’m happy to see him again. He sleeps over.

This last event was a month ago. For what happened after, I don’t really need advice as confusion spoke louder than reason.  

After all this, I learnt that a lot of information regarding my situation with my ex was being passed to my ex’s friend by our common friend who I liked to confide in.  

My biggest questions would be “Who can I trust?” or “Am I being manipulated?”. I need help in seeing things straight.

I am now taking alone time from both of them to think instead of feeling my way through the situation. I remaining single a good idea ?

relationship_advice,"so this is a long story but me (F24) and my partner (nonbinary 26) met 2 years ago on tinder, it was during lockdown so we just texted for a few months before going on our first date, by the second date they asked me to be their gf and of course i said yes. we fell in love super quickly, they were so kind to me and made me feel more loved than i thought was ever possible for myself. they were super affectionate and always gifting me things, buying me little plants and flowers. after a few months they changed really quickly they stopped being affectionate unless they were drunk and just in general seemed to not care us much about me, things went downhill very fast to the point we would argue a lot, especially if we had been out drinking, all our built up emotions would come out. eventually things got better towards the end of the first year and we began to feel like us again. going into 2022 things got bad again, tbh our whole relationship has felt so up and down. they started drinking a lot and lying to me about going out with certain people, they’d tell me they were at home or couldn’t stay over at mine because they had work the next day but it would soon be revealed they were just out with their friends? i always found this such a strange thing to lie about because i’d never be mad about them hanging out with other people? what made me mad is lying about it. then one morning they phoned me crying their eyes out saying they need to come talk to me because something bad happened. they came over and told me they had been out and drunk and another girl kissed them and they allowed it to happen. i know it might not seem so serious to some people since it’s only a kiss, but at this point they didn’t even want to have sex with me so for them to be kissing other girls made me feel horrible. i didn’t really get a chance to express how this made me feel because they were quick to play the victim and say how much pain it’s causing them. we moved on from this and while things weren’t great they weren’t bad either, but it definitely felt like something was missing/wrong. i brought up multiple times how i didn’t really feel like we were in a relationship it felt like a friendship, but they never really acknowledged this tbh. fast forward to summer, we had a huge argument one night where they told me they weren’t in love with me anymore and didn’t want to be with me. this was the worst thing i think i’ve ever had to hear, being in love with someone and being told that? it made me want to die. the next day we decided to stay together and work on things. we ended up going to tenerife for a holiday in august and had a great time, and they told me they are in love with me and want things to work. september 1st comes around and they call me out of the blue one night and say they are breaking up with me and aren’t in love with me, they don’t see a future with me and basically that’s it. a week or so later we met up and decided we’d hang out and try fix things and see if it could work but we weren’t back together. this lasted for a few weeks, and it was awful i have never felt so unloved or unworthy in my life. i texted them saying how i felt and how it seemed that it was only me putting the effort in so i didn’t really see a point in trying anymore. so, we decided to completely cut contact and move on. i began going on dates and talking to other people, i have to say i wasn’t really ready but after being messed around so much i really just wanted to feel something and to distract myself. end of november i’m lying in bed at night after work and i receive a text from them asking if i’m free for a call, i said yes and we spoke for a couple of hours about everything they said they still love me and want to see me and would love to go on a date, i felt like i was talking to the old them, the person i met the first time. they came over and we slept together and for weeks it was lovely it felt like we were in our honeymoon phase again? but things quickly started to go wrong again, i couldn’t stop thinking about the things that had previously happened, looking back at our texts where they’d called me stupid, an idiot, delusional, how they said they didn’t love me and never saw a future with me. i guess it was all getting to me. one night they looked through my phone and started an argument because i had been speaking to other girls when we had broken up? i was single and i genuinely can’t understand how i didn’t anything wrong here?  things just began to feel very weird.  i felt like they were keeping me a secret also, they never post me on social media, or repost stories that i post of them, but they’ll do that with their friends? they don’t even like my instagram posts? isn’t that a little weird? the other weekend we ended up having a big argument, i guess things were just getting to both of us. they said how they never want to kiss me or have sex with me and they thought they could do the whole affectionate thing but they can’t. they basically told me again that they aren’t in love with me. that broke me again and i started crying of course to which they called me manipulative! they also said i’m the one who needs to change because i “don’t like when they hang out with their friends” which is not true, i don’t like when they lie about it. the next day we spoke about it and they apologised, and said that i shouldn’t worry because we’re fine. i’m really not sure what to do at this point i love them so much and i want things to work, it’s so difficult because i have all my friends telling me to break things off but i keep hoping things will change? i’m not sure if i really am delusional. this isn’t even half of the insane stuff that’s happened and i am by no means an angel, i’m a very insecure person and i know that also affects our relationship. i just don’t know if we stand a chance anymore",0,should i (24F) break up with my partner(26 NB) of 2 years,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8868192,1682513316,0,1682513327,1682513327,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,12,1154

relationship_advice,"I realise that this may come across as toxic, and I hate myself for it. But I can't stop thinking about her. We met last year and bonded immedietley. I think it's safe to assume that we know more about each other than anyone else in our lives. She knows I have a crush on her, and we've even shared a couple moments (she's bi). The painful part is that anytime she describes her dream partner, I am always able to fit every point. And I realise that I can't force someone to like me, obviously not a choice and she's my best friend, but it's painful everyday and just keeps getting worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, a new guy was introduced to us and he seems pretty chill. The issue is that she's trying so hard to please him, and it keeps hurting her. But she won't stop. He hasn't  admitted to it, but I know he likes her. And I want her to be happy, and I realise that it may not be with me, but it's not with him either. He reminds her of her insecurities, almost every evening. And she doesn't deserve that. She deserves so much more than that guy, or even me. But I don't know how to tell her that. I don't know how to help her realise her own worth without hurting myself in the process. I've accepted that I may never have a chance with her, and that I may not be what she wants. But it still hurts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I might've rambled a bit, sorry about that. Main point is that I want to help her in this, but I can't do it without hurting myself with the thought of her being treated this way. I don't want to lose her, so I'm too scared to do anything. I don't know if there's any advice that I can receive right now, maybe  just wanted a place to share this because I felt alone in this situation. I don't like the feeling of jealousy, it feels so dirty. So maybe some advice in that department might help.

relationship_advice,"I (25m) graduated OSUT for the US Army, just this last month. However, while I was there, I and another individual (I'll refer to him as Tom for now) ended up forming quite strong attachments to one another. During my 22 weeks of OSUT, Tom (22m) and I quickly became really good friends, and only a couple months later, we both started to notice a chemistry between us. Though we both tried our best to ignore it due to us being in an Army training environment, eventually we found it almost impossible to conceal. As time went on, our relationship began to grow more and more, and it wasn't long before others took notice as well. I did take a step back, just to see if these were actual feelings or if I had been developing a form of Stockholm syndrome due to me being away from the real world for a time. 

Thankfully, in December, we all went on HBL (Holiday Block Leave) for 21 days and were allowed to spend the holidays with our families. Even though we barely communicated during that time, there were days where he kept popping up in my mind, though I tried to fight it. When we came back, instantly, we were back side by side. As I apologized to him for the lack of communication, and gave him an explanation as to why, he told me he experienced similar thoughts. At that point, it was clear to me these feelings were real and not just the result of us being trapped in the same area with each other for months on end. If anything, our attachments only seemed to have grown.

As the weeks passed by, we found our selves not caring much anymore about who noticed or what they thought. There was even a time or two where Drill Sergeants caught us cuddling in our bunks, though they never said anything other than to tell us to stop at the moment. Eventually we ended up kissing during our last field training exercise, and our feelings at that point were pretty concrete. The talk of an actual relationship was a constant after that, however, we were both afraid of being sent to different duty stations after training was done, and neither of us were too sure if long distance was something we wanted. When we finally graduated, we ended up staying at Fort Benning for three weeks as hold overs, waiting to hear where we'd be going and when. During those three weeks, we acted as if we were already in a legitimate relationship. We were constantly going on coffee and dinner dates off post, and just having a generally good time.

When the day finally came that we were told we were leaving, it was both a sad and happy day. Happy that we were finally leaving Fort Benning, but sad because we were going to opposite ends of the country. When we were at the airport, we had our last little lunch date, and it was a rather difficult goodbye. I couldn't help but feel slightly melancholy as I watched his plane leave the gate. He's now at Ft. Lewis, WA, and I'm at Ft. Drum, NY, living two very different lives. The first week or so went by and communication was a bit slim with us adjusting to the change, and meeting new people. 

After we both got settled in a little bit, we started texting rather frequently again, and eventually discussed our feelings hadn't gone away. However, he's very unsure of the distance, and I don't blame him. We've both been in a long distance relationship before and neither of us had a great experience with it. I would like to try and see if this could work out between us, and I know he's on the fence about it. We both understand that in the military, life is constantly changing and people come and go. But this time, it's difficult to accept that. We're planning to see each other, and going on a camping trip when we're able to get leave approval. At the moment, it's just as friends, but I know that it won't stay that way during this trip. I just don't know if it's right to persue it, or if I should move on and just be friends.",0,I (25m) Fell for Someone (22m) in Basic Training/OSUT,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8868176,1682513100,0,1682513118,1682513119,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,9,724

relationship_advice,"I want to start by saying I have a very amazing relationship with this girl and we have both been through a lot with eachother for the better part of a year (3 or 4 years as friends before that). I love her in every way, our ideas almost always line up, we have so much In common, it's always so easy to relate to eachother.

The issue starts when the topic of sex comes up. She has an IUD so we like to have unprotected sex (kissing and foreplay turning into doggy or missionary). I like this sex and it is very intimate, but I've always liked something more. I really enjoy (although I've never experienced it) having a submissive partner. Someone who try to do things I say to pleasure me the best they can. I'm not talking about a sex slave, just someone who would enjoy the act of pleasuring me.

Now let me clarify, I'm not selfish. I am a giver by nature, I will give the greatest oral even if my jaw feels like it's going to break and even if I'm fighting to breathe, even if I'm very uncomfortable. I don't really expect others to do the same, but again it's what I fantasize, it's what I really want.

One thing I've been sort of obsessed about is facefucking, including throat fucking, cum in mouth, blowjobs, etc. I've tried facefucking with her but it was very gentle and I knew she wasn't really enjoying it, so I stopped. (I was eating her out at the same time and she gave me no sign of arousal at all)

My girlfriend has been sexually assaulted at age 14 with oral activities so it's a hard topic for her, but she's told me several times that she's never felt or thought about that trauma when having any sort of sex with me, but she has a wall or anxiety stopping her. 

We've talked so much about it together that I don't even want to talk about it anymore, but long story short, I don't know if she will ever want to be that submissive for me. She tells me she wants to more than anything, but I know she just means she wants to see me happy. 

TLDR: My girlfriend (who i otherwise love in every way) doesn't really align with my sexual needs. She has had past trauma but I'm not sure of that's  why she wouldn't like to do it, or if it's because she really just doesn't like to do that for me.

Is this something I should really try help her through and see if she becomes comfortable with these sorts of things? Is there something I'm missing here? Am I an asshole for wanting this sort of extreme dominant sex?

Any insight would be helpful. Thanks",0,My(21F) GF doesn't enjoy mostly anything that I (22M) enjoy sexually,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8868138,1682512543,0,1682512556,1682512556,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,11,474

I wanted to confide in him and told him about the way I was handled by guys in the past and how they cheated on me.

My ex started insulting me and told me why I let them go and should have taken matters serious and threatened them.

From this I could tell my boyfriend was ultra-conservative but I m just left in confusion as to how it was my fault for the way they treated me and what he expected me to do about them.

relationship_advice,"A little backstory and some context. 

One of my aunties (Aunty A) lives with my grandparents. The other sisters (including my mum) frequent their house often to look after them. They usually have at least one aunty at home with my grandparents at all times.

My mum usually goes for a few hours a couple of times a week. She's asked that if they need her there longer, to let her know at least a day in advance so she can get her errands done or reschedule things as needed. But on one particular day, no one told her she was needed for a whole day and she was just forced to stay there and wait until Aunty A returned home. This led to a huge misunderstanding/fight between my mum and her sisters. 

Previously, when they've had fights, they don't tend to drag us, the grandchildren, into it. But this time, long story short, insults and accusations were thrown around, and grandchildren (including me) were dragged into it. My grandparents were caught in the middle of all this and did not get to have a say in what was happening. 

My mum backed off and hasn't been to see her parents in a few months. As a result, I haven't either... I just want my grandparents to live peacefully and not have to witness the unnecessary fights and arguments. 

I'm proud of my mum for taking a stand and for not letting her sisters bully/take advantage of her. But if I visit now, I have no doubt Aunty A will call the others, which will reignite the feud and cause a ruckus at my grandparents house. The last thing I want is to cause trouble for them but I miss them dearly and would love nothing more than to see them.

One of my aunties is completely hot headed... and somehow seems to be pulling the strings, so trying to arrange a mediation or a sit down between my mum and her sisters is absolutely out of the question.

At a loss of what to do. So far all I have is that I just have to give it time.

TLDR; I haven't seen my grandparents for a few months because of a fight my mum had with her sisters. If I try to see them now I know it will cause a ruckus at their house, which is the absolute last thing that I want.",0,I [30F] miss my grandparents [90M 90F],r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8868111,1682512046,0,1682512064,1682512065,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,7,406

relationship_advice,"Hey all, so my GF and I have been together for more then a year and a half almost 2 years so we're pretty serious. I am her 4th or 5th boyfriend, 2nd serious relationship, but 1st healthy and non-toxic relationship according to her and she is my first for everything.

I will admit in the beginning the relationship wasn't the best but after a few months we both have grown and matured a lot together and my GF even reminds me a lot about thankful she is to have me and how much I've helped her become not just a better partner but a better person over all. She's helped me become a better person as well and really helped me mature too.

I will be graduating college pretty soon, and I've been applying for jobs around my hometown buy can't find anything, a lot of places close to my home town would be a 1-2hour drive so I would have to move, and if I have to move I want to go somewhere I want to go. 

So at the moment, my plan is if I can't find anything by the end of summer, to move ~16-17 hours away (~1000 miles) to where my dad lives as he lives in a better area for tech job's and hope I can find a job there (plus I fell in love with that city after my dad moved there). My original plan was to get a job in my home town, live with my mom and work for a year or 2 then move to one of 2 cities I've been looking at moving to.

So my issue is, if we do move together, what happens if it doesn't work out, she won't have any family down there and it's a big drive/move to make to go back home to her family if we don't work out. I really love my GF and though I do see a future with her, part of me is also scared about it because I don't want her to go through the stress and hassle of moving all on her own like that just in case we don't work out. We also have quite the history together, (long story short something traumatic happened and though it helped us grow together it was still an experience I wish we didn't  have to go through) so I'd feel even more guilty leaving her if something where to happen or if we don't move together. Maybe if we were together a little longer other then ~1.5 years, part of me thinks it's too soon but it's also not early enough to move by my self and not have to worry if you know what I mean.

We have talked about it a little and my GF is more then very enthusiastic and wants to move with me, I also plan on having a big talk about it after I graduate and move back home though too.

relationship_advice,"Equal parts ranting and asking for advice.

As the title suggests,  that is his love language. 

He recently mentioned that I hadn't been doing anything along those lines for him, especially as he was observing the Muslim fast and I decided to pick something that I could do to change that.

So for the past 2 weeks, I was making dinner daily, save for maybe 3 nights where I was late and found him cooing, I went to see a friend and the other we ate out. This was in addition to making his bed (we were sleeping separately because he was fasting), and doing the dishes although he did help out on this sometimes. Given our work schedules and how little time we spend at our place, these seemed like the most effective things. 

Now, I'm not a very active person, physically speaking. I get exhausted really easily (it's not a medical condition) so I generally prefer to pay someone to get things done like going out to get food, lifting things or even cleaning the house. And I always pay out of my pocket because I understand that sometimes it's my responsibility to do some of those things; and even if it's not, I don't understand why he should strain himself to do something that someone else can do so cheaply. 

So you can imagine how surprised I was when on Sunday, I made myself a rather large breakfast and my boyfriend walks in and jokingly comments on how much I'm taking care of myself and returns a few minutes later to (gently and calmly) tell me how he has mentioned that his love language is acts of service but I don't do the same. 
For context: he was fasting, which is why I didn't include him in the meal - he wouldn't eat anyway; and secondly, the breakfast was just milk and egg-fried bread which I only made because the bread was mouldy and not edible unless you did so much to it, like frying it, and the egg had cracked and my only alternative was to throw both away - which I didn't want to do because that's a wastage of food. Any other case, and I was going out to look for lunch (we woke up late and it was almost 1pm)

The thing that disturbed me - and I pointed out to him - is that for almost 2 solid weeks, I had willingly gone out of my way to do some sort of service for him. And I did that because I knew his love language and I wanted to obviously make him as happy as he makes me when he does mine.
So I asked him what exactly I had been doing in the past weeks? Nothing? And he said I didn't cook everyday(true, because I bulk-cook some type of soup, usually chicken every 3 days and reheat it and make fresh solid food daily). However, this was his idea, not mine. I don't like eating the same meal twice so I actually prefer making fresh food everyday. He didn't offer any other explanation for his disappointment or feelings in general.

I don't get it. Was I wrong to feed myself? To make something from the food that would otherwise be thrown out?

And while what I was doing may not seem like much, I usually don't cook. I'll order out, choose to physically go buy food, but rarely cook. Of all household duties, cooking exhausts me the most and most times, if I do it, it's the only thing I can manage to do that day. And he knows this. So yes, it definitely should have counted for something that I was cooking daily. 
But it didn't and I don't understand why... especially because he has told me before that he'd be so happy if I could pick even just one thing that I can do as a service for him.

There was also an incident last year where i had injured my ankle. It wasn't very serious, but I was limping. One Friday night, I went out with my friends. The next day, he insisted that I carry a 20l bottle from the ground floor to our 3rd floor and got upset when I called the gate man to do it in exchange fir a very small tip. He claimed I was wasting money, and that if I was so injured, how come I was out with my friends? 
I get that he wants to do things myself: he has actually told me that when he sees me moving about it makes him really happy, whether I'm going out to get food or doing something around the house. However, I still don't understand what difference it makes if I pay someone else to do the thing because at the end of the day, the thing has been done?

For avoidance of doubt, he really does do acts if service for me. However, I don't really perceive them as ""I'm feeling loved "". But that's okay because he does cuddle most nights, gets me flowers sometimes and cute little things and that's a sufficient dose.

I'm now wondering what else I should be doing. Or if what I do is just not enough. Or if I'm just lazy and I should change my attitude- I'm open to that cos otherwise I just feel like I'm physically exhausting myself unnecessarily. 

I've got half a mind to pick something that I can easily do and just consistently do that for as long as I can but now I worry that he'll come up to me and say I'm not doing anything? 


The other confusing thing is that physical touch and receiving gifts are my lobe languages. Specifically, physical touch is how I most receive love and gifts, though a close second, is how I most show it. We had an incident last year where I was sad about how much the birthday presents I got him didn't seem to matter much to him, even though I got exactly what he had mentioned over time that he wanted. I was hurt because it took a lot of time, effort and money to get them and yet he wasn't that excited to receive them. But I get it. That's not his love language. 
However, on our second anniversary later that year (we have two every year), I didn't get him a present and he was really upset about it and claimed I should have gotten him something, however small. I pressed him and told him he doesn't view gifts the way that i do (and i didnt have or want to spend money on soemthing thag wouldnt mean much to him - i dont have a lot to begin with). His response was that, as presents matter so much to me, I should've considered him too for a present however small. Further confusion. Anyway 

For those with this love language, what are some of the things that your partners do for you that really hit the spot? And also how often should they do them for it to count?
I also don't want to ask him because I don't want to to seem like a ""you're only doing abcd because I asked"" situation. I want it to seem like I gave it some thought and pushed myself to do it because I think it will mean more that way and really make him feel loved.

I am a teacher at a kindergarten and I have just been put in the same classroom as my work crush (F26, let’s call her Liz) since the beginning of this month and feelings are starting to get kinda stronger (?) since starting to work with her &amp; seeing her every day. 
I should specify that I’m an English teacher in a Japanese kindergarten so my story would make a little more sense. 
My wife has been working more this year since she got a new job with a 1.5 hour commute. I feel like i rarely see her and when I do, it is hard to fight for her attention because she usually will give it to our daughter or herself.

 I try to stay active as a father and am always doing the house chores, cooking, pickup and drop off at daycare (she goes to daycare at my workplace) and I just feel like a single parent. Basically I only see my wife from 6am to 7:30am and she gets home at around 9-10pm and we are asleep by then. 

The crush.

Of course being a straight guy working around mostly young female teachers, who wouldn’t find some of them attractive. There’s been this one teacher who speaks rarely any English who has always been incredibly kind to me &amp; a bit flirty since I’ve met her (complimenting my haircut, and saying I smell good and dress well. Going out of her way to talk to me at work and outside work functions.) I always chalked it up to her just being a nice person. 

I’ll be fair and say I’ve kind of flirted with a her a little too just saying her haircut is nice and her shirt is fun etc and she always blushed hard &amp;said something like “oh really, stop it, I’m embarrassed” in Japanese since they are usually pretty humble people

This April she was placed in the same classroom as me and we have been talking more due to being in close proximity and same class. 

Before the school year started I gave her a small gift of coffee beans since it’s customary to give small gifts to coworkers and she texted me for the first time that weekend saying thank you for the gift with pictures of her coffee grinder and coffee pour over kit. 

Little signs I noticed that she was into me were her touching my hands, catching her looking at me at random times and one time I asked her “what part of Japan are you from?” And  she straight up replied  “I grew up down the street , I went to this same kindergarten too. One day I wanna marry a nice papa like you Mr.OP” I’ve never seen her do this to my other married male coworkers. 

I’ve even casually dropped all these things Liz does&amp; says to my wife in conversation and I never sensed any jealousy from my wife. She just thought that Liz was a nice person to me.

I guess am i overthinking this because she is a pretty girl who talks to me while my wife is kind of absent in my life as of lately? Maybe she isn’t even into me just a super nice person. I am smart enough to know that if I act on this crush it is going to be a sh** show, I just feel like I need to get this off my chest since I have nobody to talk about this to.

relationship_advice,"Tldr: met a person about 2.5 years ago. asked her out a few months in, she said no. I tried and failed to get over it and now I feel even stronger about her. 

I think I knew I really wanted to date her on Christmas 2021. We went to see the giant tree in NYC because she never saw it before. We got a little swept up in the crowd and she held my hand so we didn't get separated. I asked her out pretty close to then and she said she'd think about it. I think/hope she really did give it some thought but she said something along the lines of not wanting to risk breaking up and not being friends anymore. Probably the nicest no I could imagine to be honest.  

Anyway about that time I started heavily using drugs in the hopes of making my feelings go away faster (bad idea btw). I was pretty messed up every day 24/7 and the stuff/amount of stuff I took made my psych disorder a lot worse. She still put up with me despite being deeply suicidal most of the time and having frequent breakdowns. 

During this time we also tripped together like 3 or 4 times. Those were the only times I recall being genuinely happy the last few years. Unfortunately when you trip trip together I think you bond a little closer so it wasn't really helping me not be in love with her. 

I've currently been sober for a few months and have no intention of ever becoming addicted to anything. My feelings are less intense now but I am definitely even more in love with her than I was when I wasnt sober. I've met a ton of people over the last two years too in attempt to put my feelings elsewhere but no one ever felt the same. 

We hang out pretty much every weekend and have done a ton of really interesting things together like metal detecting, camping, dnd, etc. I even went to my first gay bar with her and got not blackout drunk for the first time also. Maybe I just wanna have a partner who's also my best friend and that's just a weird unusual thing? Idk 

I don't know if I should ask her again or just let it be. I figure it'd probably just be easier to die so I don't have to think about it anymore. I don't expect I'll ever feel this way about anyone again anyway 

I don't really wanna die right now but it feels like my choices are pretty limited to either that: living in weird loneliness/happiness limbo; asking her out again; cutting contact; or some secret 4th option that I'm missing. Frankly they all sound pretty awful besides dying and I hope I get brain cancer.

relationship_advice,"I just found out that my boyfriend(22M) cheated on me(20F) a year into our 5 year relationship. I went through his phone and found sexts from another girl who he still speaks to, although she’s dating a woman now. It was only sexting, confirmed by the other girl. Our relationship was on the rocks and he ended up breaking up with me a couple weeks after it started over the guilt but not telling me. We “broke up” for a few months but were still seeing each other. He was also still sexting with her for a couple weeks after. We got back together and have since moved in together and gotten a cat, and I was expecting to be engaged within the next couple years. I’ve told him dozens of times that my biggest fear was being cheated on without knowing. I’ve asked him if he’s cheated on me dozens of times, both joking and serious, and he’s lied to my face about it for four years. He also lied about talking to other girls while we were broken up, many of whom he also still speaks to. I can forgive the cheating (we were only 17/18 at the time, he had a pill and alcohol problem, shit happens) but I can’t get over the fact that he’s held onto this for four years. I always thought he was a bad liar but clearly I was wrong. When I confronted him he immediately apologized and offered to delete social media and go to therapy, but he also attempted to continue lying by saying he remembered the sexts but not the fact that we were together during them (weird lie). I’ve gotten him to admit that he remembers and made him tell me a lot of details. I just don’t know what to do because I love him and I don’t want to throw it away on a teenage mistake but I’m scared to find out what else he’s been lying about if he can keep a secret like this for so long. I’m so confused and I feel like I don’t even know him. Is this salvageable? Can we make it work? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

relationship_advice,"Background: So my boyfriend and I (both 20) have been dating for 6 months. Before I started dating him I was dating one guy for almost 5 years. Sounds stupid yes I know I'm still young.
When that relationship ended it was bad. Tears, throwing things, the whole 9 yards (he cheated on me while I was in military bootcamp then after I got out didn't tell me he was cheating for an entire year)... but even so, ever sense I honestly can't help but miss it. Not the guy itself just, how the relationship was before it went bad.
The guy I'm with now has liked me sense middle school. Stated it multiple times and every year has asked me out once or twice. He's a great guy, very loving and very sweet when he wants to be. He makes time for me and does stuff I wanna do as well as random gifts now and then. I love him, but for some reason I just can't shake the feeling it's not like my last one.

My problems: We've had fights. Lots of them. He tends to not think before speaking. Like to the point it's been a problem. He always apologizes if it hurts my feelings but only if he realizes it. He's said things in the middle of sex that would on its own make me cry. He is very clingy and protective, basically lost half my friends if not more sense he gets worried they are guys. He puts up a tough act out in public and with others that pisses everyone off but then alone he usually calms down. I say usually because half the time it's him being snuggly or him wanting sex. One or the other.

relationship_advice,"I am seeking some advice on how to handle a situation with my ex-girlfriend. To give you some context, I was in a relationship with her for about a year, but I didn't treat her the way she deserved to be treated. I wasn't abusive or anything, but I didn't give her the attention she needed and would often take her for granted.

Eventually, she reached her limit and left me after going through a lot of hoops to get me to like her. Recently, I found out that she has a new boyfriend, but she called me and said that she will always have a thing for me.

I feel really confused and don't know what to do. Part of me wants to try and win her back, but I also don't want to cause any more harm to her. I regret not treating her the way she deserved and I want to make it right, but I don't know if that's even possible.

relationship_advice,"Hello all, 

So Ive been with this man for the last 4 almost 5 years this time. Previously we were together roughly 14 years ago for about 2 years and he had to go away for awhile. We first started our relationship back when we were just out of highschool and we ment everything to each other. I tried to stay with him throughout the time he needed to serve. I only lasted only 9 months. I could t do it. There were other factors that came about nothing personal but it just didn't work for us at that time in our lives. My sisters and mom still considered him as a brother and son in-law. And that extended with his family as well, his mom was my mom, and his brother was literally my best friend for multiple years to follow.
After he was out we talked here and there he was working regularly and living in a halfway house. Not because of drugs or drinking, it was apart of him coming back as a citizen. I had visited him at that half way house about 3 times while I was dating someone. I wanted to give him the support the best I could with being in a relationship. With that relationship I gave birth to one amazing boy. This person I'm talking about still understood why I had a child and has been the best and most understanding man I could ever think of. So prior when he just got out he visited at my place of employment about 3x a week for multiple months and at that time I was really fucked up. But he was still there for me and my son, the child he never helped conceive. We broke apart for about a year after that. Then my sister came home from Texas to finally move back home.. I was the person who picked her from the airport and brought her back to moms. I stayed for about two hours enjoyed her company and drove home. Not even 10 minutes I left her home I got a message from her saying that he was there. I literally missed the love of my life by just a few minutes. So my sister, him and I decided it was best to go get some food somewhere. We all meet at this restaurant and our song came on, we both looked at each other and said that we could try this again, and we did. We are now on year 4 almost 5 in October. But as of now he is working 1000 miles away from our home and we are going on 4 months this Sunday. I have no trust with him. I don't know how to do it anymore. So the first year of our recent time together I cheated and had sexual contact with my ex boyfriend and he hasn't been normal since, I know I fucked up. I would never think about doing anything like that to him again. Je is my person no questions. But Multiple women calling started calling him and asking for him to support them going through treatment. The only way I found out is because we would be out doing something like grocery shopping and then he would take a call and disappear for a short period. I let it go for about 5 times before I asked. And he told me it was a girl from a long time ago and he would call her when he was gone so she is looking for support. Later on I found out this was completely untrue. It was the woman that stayed with him in the halfway house. I don't know what to say from here because I feel like after I just typed this out, I shouldnt even go further with my explanations. 
So this girl actually was staying with him in his halfway house and she was with him and going strong. But he described it to me as a friend who lost a parent and was wasted all the time. I feel better and may ebelieve that now. So now we are on our 4th year together going on 5 in October. But he is working out of state and has been gone for 4 months this Sunday. He has been very weird with his time, and can't explain much he is but he is very short. I drove down about a month ago to visit with my son and he was very happy and we all enjoyed our time together. We also bought a camper and accomplished so much being there with him. But now he is staying at his ex girlfriends house (she has a boyfriend now, he is my boyfriend's rebound to say the least). But I've had trust issues with him for the last year between paying for illicit videos, talking and saying things to woman he shouldn't be saying; And on top of it he won't give me that attention and I've brought it up so many times I can't even count... 

So my issue is that he is now staying in this house with the woman he dated just prior to me. He isn't his ""normal self"" going to bed early like 9pm when he has always gone to bed at midnight. So this woman will send me snaps just prior to him calling me to say goodnight,  but with her saying she is going to bed too at the same time... Then this morning he was supposed to have work. And I called him about 730-745a trying to wake him since he was supposed to be onsite at work around 6am. Thinking that he was late and needed a call since he told me the night prior that he has work. (I'm out of state and not with him.) But he never answered. And I saw that she was on Facebook and Instagram just a few minutes after I tried to call and wake him up. And from my understanding from her telling me she usually sleeps till 10-11am. So that makes me think she was in bed with him and woke up from me calling him. Then on top of that two days ago he sent me a bathroom mirror picture and there was a makeup bag and toothbrush bag, I asked him about it and he said it's beeen there for the past two weeks.. but this is my first time seeing this. I contacted the woman and she said it's hers and she had to leave in a hurry and count take it. What woman leaves her make-up bag and toothbrush when you are going to live 3 states away for at least 4 months. So he is still going to bed when she sends me videos of he in her room or living room sleeping and he sends; ne goodnight messages or call at the same time. I'm in a total mind fuck with this. And him and I just talked about all of this for 6 hrs non stop  two days ago. I don't believe it. Oh and he didn't feel like he need to tell me that she has been there since the day we talked about our relationship and how it's going to work for that 6hrs. I'm at a total loss for words and what I should do and who I should believe. I feel like I'm going crazy. But he literally won't even come home. I've tried to buv multiple plane tickets for him for  just one for a few days and he declined it.

What do I do?
Is it worth my fight? I feel like I'm completely losing myself trying to make this work. Does he even care? I feel so disgusted, I know this isn't a normal relationship. But I'm to the point myself that I want to give up. 
In the past year I've cought him over 7 times. And that's just what I've cought him doing. He completely denies everything unless I have proof. I'm just done. I'm almost 35, I want a real boyfriend. Fuck I want to be married and be happy and have some type of eternal love with my best friend. But right now, that few months I feel like no matter what I'll never get it. I seriously can't do this anymore.",0,Honest advice,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8867792,1682506862,0,1682506875,1682506875,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,2,1401

relationship_advice,"# TLDR:

One day, a beautiful girl caught my attention, and I started talking to her after our coach moved us into the same batch. I've been flirting with her, but I'm not really sure if she's been flirting back, although I've noticed some signs. I'm quite nervous because I think she's way more attractive than myself, and I don't know what to do.
***

This one day, I was packing my stuff up in badminton class, and this BEAUTIFUL girl walked in. I literally had to stop staring at her so that I didn't look like a pervert.

I started talking to her after our coach moved us into the same batch. We started talking, I have a certain way of interacting with girls that I'm interested in, which involves a combination of trolling and flirting. This includes intentionally doing things that annoy her or going out of my way to try to win against her more than I would with other people.

And I can't tell if she's been flirting back and its driving me crazy. She did [this](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/78467549.cms) VERY mindfully of her position (which was right ahead of me while we were in a queue), showcasing her butt.

He's quite experienced and has had relationships in the past. The other night he was playing with my breasts w/o a bra but my heart was beating like crazy and I was shaking slightly because of nerves to the point where he actually stopped because he didn't feel comfortable continuing because of my reaction, even though I was enjoying it, I just couldn't help my nerves. He's said we can take things slow and go at my pace. He's staying over on the weekend and I feel like we may end up having sex. I do want my first time to be with him and I feel I may be ready but I'm nervous. He's said he'll top if I'd prefer (thank god) and he already knows what I like and what feels good for me.

relationship_advice,"I feel like I'm in a complex and confusing situation. I've been with my husband for 7 years. When we were dating everything was amazing. But once we got married things shifted. He started making more money, and being more demanding at home.

We stopped going on dates as much, due to stress and work, and covid. Our daily routine became very rigid, very quickly. He started criticizing little things I did. The coffee, my taste in décor, my food, my clothes, my hair. He kept picking at things and I kept telling myself it wasn't a big deal. I asked him to learn how to cook with me, and he laughed in my face, saying he had no interest in cooking. He stopped helping me clean pretty quickly after that.

I'd make him coffee and a lot of the time it wasn't ""good enough"" for him to drink so he'd pour it down the drain. So I tried harder. It became a stressful way to start the day, making him a cup of coffee that he was happy with.

Every now and again he'd say something so hurtful that I'd be shocked. I'd start wondering if that was what he really thought of me. The most hurtful things were comments about things I knew he knew I was insecure about. When I'd bring it up he would say that he was obviously joking and that he would never intend to hurt me. Since he didn't intend to hurt me, there was no reason to apologize.

I'd talk about getting back in shape and he'd tell me that I've never been ""in shape"", or I'd ask him to help me with a maths problem and he'd make fun of me for not understanding it. He told me I was awkward and bad in bed, that I ""run like a retard"", that he can't be responsible for the fact that every 3rd thing I say is incorrect and that I don't have any friends...

The real blow was when I'd try to discuss my hurt feelings with him, he'd completely shut down and refuse to discuss it with me. I'm not perfect and when I felt hurt I'd get angry. My temper would flare and he'd tell me I was making a big deal out of nothing. He kept telling me I was overreacting, that my childhood was making me misinterpret things, and that I was too sensitive.

I started retreating emotionally. I didn't want to go on dates or have sex with him. He also retreated into work and his hobbies. When I tried to talk to him about fixing our communication, he'd tell me there were no problems. He loves me and I am difficult to live with. I brought up couples counseling last year and he laughed at me. He said we were happily married and that I was being silly.

I felt like I had gone crazy. I started journaling and writing everything down. Here I was married to a man who was so precise about everything, who was so insistent on being factually correct about all things big and small that he often googled things I said in conversation to fact-check them, but when he said insensitive and hurtful things to me, about me, then I was supposed to know he was only joking.

Over Christmas I became depressed, sought out talk therapy and got on anti-depressants. I felt like I was trapped in a cage and decided I'd had enough. I sat my husband down and told him it was over. He was furious and said I couldn't divorce him out of nowhere when there was nothing wrong in our relationship. I told him that I was unhappy and hurt, and that things hadn't gotten resolved.

He begged me to go to couples counseling with him. I relented. We went and when we got there he deflected any responsibility. He told the therapist I had been abused as a child, and that I was too sensitive, which is why I told on to resentment and cannot forgive things he has said.

The therapist clearly felt sorry for him and suggested we increase our intimacy by planning date nights. He was ecstatic.  We tried to go on dates, but the intimacy wasn't there. Then we'd be doing something together and he'd make another hurtful comment and I would just start crying.

Recently, after a lot of arguing, he has apologized to me for the things he has said. Even though he doesn't mean to hurt me intentionally, he can now see that he is hurting my feelings. But he claims he cannot stop himself from joking about my insecurities. He says there is no malice in his actions, that he is just trying to be funny but it goes wrong and he cannot help it.

I've been trying to decide if this is acceptable or not, or if it can be fixed? If he didn't pick at my insecurities our relationship would be almost perfect. He isn't a bad husband apart from this issue. Please help.

TW:  SA

I know it sounds crazy, and no I didn’t stay together with him. We are still broken up. We were together for 4 years. I found out a couple days after valentine’s that he had cheated on me with one of his guy friends between October and November. I went totally crazy after, relapsed with drinking and drugs and left the country for a week. This lasted about a month. He kept telling me about how suicidal he was and eventually I started feeling bad for him but then I became completely dependent on him and we’ve been with eachother almost every night since I found out (meaning we hang out more than before I found out.) A couple weeks ago I found out I was pregnant, and I want to keep it. I know that I could be setting myself up but I don’t see how I could have an abortion because of my personal view on it. I’m definitely pro choice, but it feels harder to have an abortion of my own. I’ve had one before and it was traumatic (I had an incomplete abortion, ended up in hospital over a month later and did 4 rounds of meds, I believe). I see the baby separately from him, I see it as just mine. And I’m finally feeling some kind of happiness or something to look forward to. But I feel this massive guilt for wanting to keep it, knowing how young I am. I have support from my parents and intend to do everything I can to insure a good life. I feel guilty knowing I’d purposefully be having a baby with no father. I say this because I’m not sure I feel safe with having him in the baby’s life, he has sexually assaulted me a few times now. Somehow the cheating feels worse because I forgave him for raping me. I intend to stop being with him as soon as I can.

If I have this baby, would I be selfish for not letting the baby dad in their life?

relationship_advice,"i am 28 and i met a great guy at a mutual hobby. he is 40. during the time we met I was taking pre reqs for an accelerated nursing program. fast forward months into our relationship i got into the accelerated program and all things changed. 
i knew most of my time would go into school. this was my dream to be a nurse. this is my opportunity to develop a rewarding career. fortunately he has a career. now it’s my turn. these were my goals before i even met him. school cost over 30,000. getting in is the first step. now i have to actually pass all the classes. so when we say stress, shessh i’m stressed.
I still also maintain a full time job. My program is 15 months long. He was aware of all of this prior to getting into a relationship. and Unfortunately during these months I had to put him second in my life. my relationship was not as much of a priority to me than school was at this time. I made him aware of this and it didn’t settle too well with him. He felt alone and abandon and reminded me of that quite often. 
I needed to study though. i’m not one of those people that can spend a little bit of time on something and get it. i have to spend a lot of time on it. we managed to see each other at least once a week. we did not live together and he lived over 30 minutes away from me 

during school i never felt he really supported me. I remember one time I was studying and I really did not have time to make dinner so i ate cereal. meanwhile this man never asked me if i was okay or asked if I ate. but he was eating at a whole steak house with his friends. things like that really bothered me. i felt his love was very conditional. he only did for me if i did in return. 
i could understand him if i put none important things ahead of him. but i’m in school. i’m busting my ass. I work 5am-1pm take full time classes, have clincals and manage to work out at least 3 times a week. 


I ended our relationship because I truly felt he was unhappy. i can see the shift. and with summer coming, naturally people want to be outside. so imagine how he would feel during those times

 lastly the biggest determining factor of letting him go was that i had a whole break down after taking an exam. straight up went into a panic attack and he wasn’t the one i wanted to call. that meant a lot to me. it confirm that this man really does not support me. 

i feel awful. i miss him dearly. i wish i could of went about things differently. i just wished he was able to suck up his time. it was for only 15 months. school ends in december !",0,Did I (28f) make the right decisions in ending it with (40m) bf?,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8867643,1682504709,0,1682504724,1682504724,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,13,509

He’s acknowledged it before but he just calls me a grandma and to get my labido checked which makes me even more sick that I already have enough going on and he’s making me feel bad for not wanting to have sex with him. I love him alot and i would have sex with him and it would not feel good but i still would do it because I want him to be pleased. It just gets me of the fact that he can get off to other women. In the near say beginning of our relationship he would still watch porn, he ends up going to a strip club behind my back and says he hated it lol Not sure i believe him. Then went home and talked to an AI to get off. Says he fell asleep whatever got over that. Dated a stripper prior to me. Also just had a rocky relationship where i have trauma from the way he has spoken to me which makes me not want to have sex. But yeah, not sure if it’s me or him. I’m no saint but a year ago i got caught talking to another man because i just didn’t feel safe and i regretted it, he makes me feel bad about it and i expect it. I just have not felt safe. But I could probably go on i just feel off because he makes me feel so bad for not wanting to have sex with him. We are holding by a thread.

relationship_advice,"My husband and I have been married for 11 years. He is a sweet, extremely intelligent man. But he is a bit on the autistic spectrum and incapable of being emotionally aware.
I have really felt lonely because of this. I have truly tried everything, I have at some point even written down things he could say when I need his help (which sounds ridiculous). And he has improved in that he now at least asks questions rather than zoning out or remaining silent. But he doesn’t really know what to respond.

We went to couples therapy together and the therapist had a very serious almost an accusing look on her face towards me, and said that a husband can’t cover all my needs. They are hundreds of things he can be, but my emotional supporter is not one of them. My husband noded and agreed that I should maybe rely on my friends for that.

About 1,5 years ago, we were on a holiday trip together. My mom and I went on a walk with my baby when a skydiver lands infront of me. I took a video, approached the guy and told him I took a video in case he wanted it. He gave me his number and I sent the video.

We started texting shortly after. He was married with 2 kids, he lives 1hr from where I live. His wife cheated on him, he was having a hard time, and I walked him through everything. Supported him, listened, helped. He is very emotionally aware, sensitive, very caring- I have never met anyone like this. We have been our emotional support system, know everything about each other, are guiding us through the stress of parenthood, relationships etc. We have met maybe 3-4 times, so mostly talk, chat etc. He has become my closest, dearest friend and I absolutely love him platonically.

However, I can’t get over the fact that this is not my husband, and sometimes I do wonder how being married to someone who is your emotional support would feel like. 

My husband knows of our relationship of course. Maybe not the depth, not because i don’t tell him but because he doesn’t know what that entails. He doesn’t really care, or have an opinion, but I do feel like this could be perceived as emotional cheating. Because I feel a level of trust, closeness and support that I don’t feel with my husband. And even though this is what the therapist suggested, I am not sure how to feel. What is your opinion?

relationship_advice,"I’ve been with my bf for a few months now. Our relationship moved on quick and it was great at the beginning. However, after a while I felt like he was being quite different to what he was like when we first met. Not as affectionate and present. We would barely talk and even when we did it would never be a continuous conversation just texts back and forth er whenever he’d reply. 

I did talk to him about it and that conversation wasn’t very productive, he was being defensive instead of trying to understand where I’m coming from. After we had that talk, which was about three weeks ago, I found myself pulling back. He wasn’t putting in the effort so I stopped too and focused on myself instead. 

I’ve been thinking about breaking up for a while for the reasons mentioned above and many others, I just don’t feel close or connected to him. I don’t feel comfortable just saying whatever I want whenever and I don’t feel like myself when I’m with him although I’ve tried. 

With all that being said, lately he’s been suddenly more affectionate and he makes an effort to talk to me but I feel like he’s just doing that because he noticed my distance. I can’t even say love you back these days and I’m scared if I give back in he’ll feel comfortable again (which is the reason he gave to why he wasn’t being as affectionate before, said he felt comfortable in the relationship) and go back to how he was before. 

I really like him and think he’s a great man and makes a great boyfriend too just not with me which kinda hurts to think about. 

Whenever I feel set on the breakup he says or does something that just pulls at my heart strings and I chicken out but then I’m back to being upset about little things.

relationship_advice,"So today was our Graduation day and It was one of the happiest and most memorable moments in my life. My gf and I ended the day by taking couple pictures and pictures with our families. Because of some emergencies my family and I had to leave first so we said our goodbyes and parted ways. Well I kind of have separation anxiety and a few seconds after I reached the car I immediately began to try and reach her but she was unreachable. She then messaged me around 10 minutes after and informed me that she had taken pictures with her family. We had a short conversation about what we wanted to do after and I joked in the middle of the conversation if any guy had taken a picture together with her. This was the only time she told me that a guy I knew had taken a picture with her and it was only the two of them. Im normally okay with her taking pictures with guys but I always want to be there beside her in the pictures as I want to show everyone that well shes mine. But this was not okay with me and we had already discussed about this before, that I was uncomfortable with her taking pictures with other guys without me. She then goes on to justify that at first she was hesitant but the guy kept calling out to her and she had obliged after a while ( she is a kind soul and has a habit of doing what ppl tell her because she feels guilty I have told her numerous times that that would cause her problems but I guess thats a hard habit to shake off). I told her that that was not a reason and she should always consider how I would feel first. Naturally because I was so happy that day and had planned to do many things with her after, I was very disappointed and became furious. I started saying some bad things but now Im just not talking to her for a while because I want to calm myself down to prevent hurting her more. Am I in the wrong for being furious about this and is being uncomfortable about that bad

relationship_advice,"Yo. I'm a 28 yo woman. I'm dating a 30 yo man, we've been together for 2 years. Our relationship started off long-distance, but only after a few months i moved to his city because of a job offer.

I'm happy with him, he has understood me a lot of times, and he was there for me in the new city when almost no one else did. But I really can't see a future with him. He still relies on his parents for the rent, food, everything. I always have to pay for his meals or stuff in general when he finishes money of that month. He does not have a job because he is focusing on a project that at moment is not giving him the chance to be independent. This makes me wonder what chance we have to live together or start a family, which is our couple project for the future. The city we live in is very expensive and I don't earn enough to support a family alone (I'm very open minded about this and I would do it if I could, but I really can't). He does not want to find a paying job, not even part time, because he says it takes time away from his project, and his family supports this. I thought that since having kids and all is not my life priority I should stop thinking about it and focus on myself since we dont even live together, without obsessing over the fact that I can't see a future with him. But I can't, because I can't even enjoy our life as ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" together: he suffers from severe depression and he never asks me out, never traveled together, all the small trips we (I...) planned...we did nothing because in the morning he doesn't want to get up to spend the day with me, he's just too depressed.

I, on the other hand, suffer with anxiety, and his behaviors are really challenging me. He rarely replies to my texts, he is easily irritable sometimes when things doesn't go as he planned with his project/his stuff/his family and this makes me so anxious. He Aldo doesn't want to meet me as much as I would like.

He is not even slightly reliable. When I ask him to do things he never does them even if it's important, I always have to remind him 2000 times. He's always late. He always forgets things.

Wasn't sure where else to post this I can't even think straight past couple days.

Things in my life have just gone to shit recently, I (21f) got pregnant with a boy (23m) I'd only known for about 3 months. We had so many problems and fights for such a new couple, like honeymoon phase, don't remember it. We had problems regarding money and intimacy and how he wanted it so much more than me (I was a virgin before we met and not to mention pregnant for most of our relationship). I felt like I should give him things he wanted cause it was 'his love language'. I left him already once before in the short 8 months ish we were together, he said he'd change and fix himself, and I know how it sounds but I totally believed him but, as you could have probably guessed it's gradually got worse. I would've procrastinated a little long but he crossed the line and put his hands on me. We had a fight about jello, fucking jello. I left the room for space, which I do often do, long story short he didn't like that and he pushed me multiple times to get me to go to the bedroom. Pushed me into the bed so I'd lay down, and we 'resolved the issue' but he didn't apologize for pushing just mocking me during the disagreement. I called my mom to cry cause the whole situation made me felt hurt, like mentally. She convinced me it'd be a good idea to call the cops. I just feel like the bad guy I feel like he really didn't deserve the charges over a little shoving. I feel like I ruined the chance to have a good relationship with the father of my child. I'm overwhelmed there's a no contact order so when police helped me gather the last of my stuff he almosted cried, and I definitely did when I left to. I can tell he didn't do it maliciously but just cause he hasn't known any other way, I feel like I'm kicking a puppy that I've been nursing bad to health. I'm overwhelmed I'm having a kid by myself, I'm broke and living with my parents, I'm talking to police and social workers.

relationship_advice,"Last night I brought up that I believe 5 years is more than enough time for dating, last year October was our 3rd year anniversary. We talk about getting married and starting a family all the time in great detail, (how many kids, discipline, finances, wedding colours, what season the wedding will be etc.). In addition, I have discontinued my birth control because we are planned to start a family soon. Even though we are both starting off in our careers, he has had 2 raises and is due for another one after he gets admitted this year and I’ll be due for a raise as well after I graduate this year as well. He also made partner at a Labour consultancy and mentioned that money wouldn’t be a problem soon. 

I thought with all of the above 5 years was a reasonable timeline to set, but he reacted very unexpectedly. At first he said I didn’t have a right to give him a time limit to propose, this really took me back, but maybe I worded it the wrong way and hurt his feelings.. idk

I said I just thought it’s a reasonable timeline to set, just something to work towards together, as we had been talking so much about the future. He then said he could propose to me in two months but “I wasn’t ready for marriage” and when I was ready, he would propose. This absolutely pissed me off because it didn’t make sense, I was ready to be the mother of his child but not his wife. I was livid, I asked him to explain what he meant by that and he said he was wasn’t serious about he said. I completely shut down and stopped talking for the rest of the time I was at his place. 

On the drive back to my place I asked him why he could make a timeline for having a baby but not marriage. He had been the one to suggest we start a family soon and I had agreed because I wanted too as well. He said he still had to build a foundation first and he “wouldn’t feel right to go to my dad at this point” so he wasn’t ready, I said we could do that together, with two incomes, we won’t be in the same place we are now in two or three years. When I asked what is a reasonable timeline for him, he said he doesn’t know, he’s under a lot of pressure and he doesn’t need this in addition. I said again how there’s no way he can be ready to have a child if he can’t handle any additional pressure and we should start considering contraceptives in that case.  He then said I can’t just be making those kinds of decisions, but he stands with what he said about not being ready and I can do “whatever I want with that info” (I assume he meant I could leave the relationship if I wanted) 

It was heated conversation; I didn’t speak much because I was second guessing myself. Was I being unreasonable with that request, how can I covey that it wasn’t a demand, or is this something I should really worry about. It just doesn’t sit right with me that he wants to get me pregnant but isn’t even thinking about when he wants to marry me. I'm so confused.

This has played on my mind since the late 2010s when it all started and I still really do not know whether or not I’m being irrational thinking that a friend is trying to “be me” and then ghosts me after years of friendship. 

Since so many years have passed now it’s not a forethought just one of those itches at the back of the brain that arises ever so often. I am still in daily contact and on good terms with her wife. 

I’ve never said this to anyone because I’m not the type of person who seeks attention of any kind. I will admit I’m the push over friend who just accepts things for what they are and I’m happy I’m my own bubble of close friends and family. 

It really is an unusual one and I really don’t know what to think anymore - so let’s begin. 

I will state here that the names have been changed for privacy reasons and my name is pretty unusual with only meeting one other person with the exact same name spelt the same way in over 40 years. It’s such an uncommon name even people I’ve know all my life still fail to spell it correctly even though it’s only 4 letters long. This will be important later. I understand my name is not reserved just for me don’t worry. 

There is no negativity intended in any wording and I apologise in advance if anyone is offended - I do not wish for any content here to be offensive. I am just confused with the situation overall. 

Me - me 40F   

(C) - (40F) Friend since high school    

(D) - (Was 40M Now 40F) Friends husband now wife 

Im not that interesting, I keep myself to myself and I’m an introvert, quiet and don’t like drama and literally you can count the total number of friends I talk with on your hands. Every friend I have I have known for a long time. 

I have a positive outlook and I want the best for everyone always putting myself at the bottom of the list of priorities and helping when asked because everyone else is more important and everyone deserves to be happy…. Just how I was brought up. 

I have been close friends with my friend (C) since high school and her husband (D) for over 10 - 20 years. This was before covid and we would meet up regularly and hang out to socialise always have fun and a laugh. Never argued or fought went away on holidays together, was best man / maid of honour at each others weddings and god parents to the 5 children of both of our families. Literally always on good terms. 

A few years ago her husband (D) announced that they are now a woman  and was always born in the wrong body. So will be getting gender reassignment surgery in the future. 

She (D)  let’s us know that they want to be referred by their new name once decided and be referred to as female - okay great good for them moving forward and becoming the person they were born to be I was honestly happy for her. 

We were not told this by (D) - we hear through (C) her wife who popped round for a cuppa tea. A little strange way to deliver the news but okay. 

A few weeks pass and (D) announced on social media that she changed  her name by deed poll  to my uncommon name spelt exactly the same - and immediately ghosts me. 

Literally not a single message, text, call or meet up in person since that day. 

She (D) will not speak to me nor has she even mentioned that she felt this way about herself in the decade of knowing her (I get it everyone has secrets nor do they need to explain anything to me or others. While it’s odd - it doesn’t bother me. But I’m genuinely happy that they are now on the road to being happy themselves after a lot of years of depression) 

I don’t mind her even using my name but what I don’t understand why not even mention it? Kinda weird since it’s so uncommon especially with the exact spelling. 

We are all still friends on Facebook which is why I can see what is going, and they can see my posts too but she isn’t sending me personal messages or anything although I have tried to strike up a neutral conversation asking how they are etc (maybe in hindsight that was wrong?) 

This being very strange and unlike her (D) usually we are pretty chatty and have enjoyed each others company. But since the announcement and name changes - nothing.  But I respect her decision and assume the “only speak when spoken to” rule is applicable. Of course I’ll talk with her (D) if she wants to talk to me. 

I figured out that in her own time she will maybe send me a message or something when she’s ready  - although I still regularly talk to her wife (C) as we are still good friends as before. Although (D) never comes up in conversation and I never want to pry but I understand it’s caused stress on their relationship unfortunately. 

So during covid everyone is staying home so I decide to try a little something to make myself feel better since I had got sick myself but not too bad - and do my hair at home first time in 5 years. 

I take a photo of my hair just after I bleached it myself since it came out pretty well at home and with a photo of some ultra vibrant fire engine red dye that I had ordered online and  I plan on applying in two days once my hair has settled after the bleaching. (salons are closed and YouTube is a godsend for tutorials). 

The next evening (D) posts a picture up on social media with the tag “looking gorgeous as a red-head” . Now bearing in mind (D) had light brown hair for 30+ years prior when I put the post up in regards to going red from blonde myself…. then notice the left over hair dye pots of the exact colour and brand in the background of the photo… 

Kinda sus or am I just over thinking? 

Her (D)  hair looked amazing by the way and I told her that with red heart emojis on her photo. Of course she didn’t reply but I respect her decision. 

Did I dye my hair red after that original photo I put up? No I stayed blonde after a toner it looked fab blonde - and I just thought it would be kinda weird if I then followed through on my original plan and dyed my hair the same red - and I wouldn’t want to burst (Ds) bubble at the time because I don’t like conflict of any kind (not my thing) - knowing it’s the first colour she’s had on her hair in her life. 

Even now several years later - still friends on social media and (D) has never messaged me, never met Mrs (D) in real life after covid ended while it’s no issue seeing and messaging (C) her wife and my long term friend. 

Since even more time has passed I’ve accepted that D will probably never talk to me, but as long as they are happy that’s all that matters. I still talk to (C) regularly and meet up. (C) never brings (D) up in conversation so I don’t bring (D) up either because I don’t want to cause any chaos because there is still friction in their relationship. 

We still drop off gifts each year for each others Christmas and birthdays. It’s just a bit… odd with the name, hair and ghosting. 

I found the red hair dye that I didn’t use on my bathroom shelf at the back this morning which lead me to write this. 

I believe everyone should be who they are and want to be in life, and most importantly - be happy. I have at least 2 transgender close friends (as well as D) so this isn’t an unusual situation or issue whatsoever on that side of things. I’m truly happy for D. 

————————————————————————— 

\* What would you think if someone changed their legal name to yours and dyed their hair your planned colour within 24 hours and ghosted you. 

\* Because the whole situation has been so strange by ghosting me. I need someone's opinion.

relationship_advice,"I think I’m in a toxic relationship but not sure?

My (27f) boyfriend (27m) have been together for 5 years, he  says I’m immature because I’m currently not working and criticises me for my hobbies like wanting to learn a language, he hates the fact I use Reddit. 

He doesn’t like me being friends with guys or having any guys on social media, I’ll be honest I haven’t listened to his demands of deleting guys in the past and have kept them and hid it from him, I know I’m in the wrong for that, he never politely asks, he demands it from me which is what I absolutely hate, it’s either his way or the high way, he found out I lied too him /kept it from him that I kept my friends on social media 

Now he says his keeping his distance and I have to prove I’m worthy of affection and closeness because he doesn’t trust me and I need to earn it back, everything is always my fault

He doesn’t kiss me, he shows no affection hasn’t done in 5 years, I tried to bring it up to him to ask if it was a problem I could fix as not being kissed makes me feel unwanted and unloved, he told me to fuck off and change the subject otherwise he would block me ?

He is selfish, only cares about himself, he would expect me too do things sexually without returning anything. we’re due  too go on a holiday (unfortunately) I’m expected too pay for all the food whilst on holiday because he spent all his money even though he was the one who asked to go on holiday , I believe it should be equal, two people paying for things equally not one person paying more than the other as I don’t believe that’s fair

There is so much more but I’d end up writing a story if I explained everything, I’m not perfect, I have made mistakes like sometimes I can be a bit moody, I have lied to him in the past when he asked if I’m in contact with one of my friends that his demanded that I cut off and delete from social media but I only said I would to please him, he has access to all my social media’s and gets mad and questions when  I change my passwords

relationship_advice,"Hi all! Hopefully I do this whole thing right and don't ramble too much.I (20NB (She/They)) married my husband (25M) last June after a long distance relationship of 2 years. He came to the USA for a month and towards the end of that time we got married. We're young, but we want to get him into the US.After he went back to his home country, we talked about our plans for getting him here. We basically agreed on one thing: we need money. He would start working more and I would get a part time job while I finished college and put away as much money as possible.For background, he has never been good with money, and was in significant credit card debt when we met. He also had a $20k inheritance he spent in the time we've been together. Well, he said he was working on paying off the credit card and was trying to save money. I believed him and thought he was trying to get better about it.Recently, we've talked more about money since I'm ready to start really pushing to get him here. I asked him how much he had saved in the past 10 months, and he said $300. I asked if his credit card was paid off, he said no. He makes great money, and should have about $400 left every week after bills, but he doesn't save any of it. He recently got a tattoo ($900), and a few months back he purchased a laptop he didn't need (he has a nice PC). He also refuses to cook and instead orders food deliveries or buys food during his lunch break.During this time, I have built a credit score of 780 as well as saved $13k. I don't make as much as him, but I also don't have a ton of expensive bills right now (car is paid off, living situation is cheap, I cook dinner all the time and never eat out).I'm frustrated, and I feel like he's not putting anything into our relationship. I know money isn't everything, but we've had conversations about this multiple times and he always says he'll try harder, but nothing changes. I love this man with my whole heart, and he has changed my life for the better. I imagine my future with him, but I can't continue to worry about his financial situation for the rest of my life. I feel like he's sabotaging us intentionally at this point. I want to buy a small manufactured home soon that we could move into while we save more money, and I hope to be able to rent it out in the future when we move on to a (hopefully) larger home, but I feel like he's not contributing to it at all. Right now I've told him that I won't be paying for him to get here. Once he's in America, he won't be able to work for a while because he needs to get everything sorted with immigration before he can work, so I'll be supporting him completely during that time. I think it's fair for him to pay for a flight here + shipping the few things he owns, but he can't even afford that.I feel like I'm going crazy. I hope this made sense.

relationship_advice,"This will be very long because I don't know how to explain situations without giving every detail.

I have been talking to H (f21) for about 6 weeks now and it is long distance. Due to certain complications, she isn't ready for a relationship quite yet, but has said things like ""I need just a lllllliiitttttlllleeeee more time but not much.""

About 5 weeks in, my ex (f22) (also long distance) returned to me, after being AWOL for 5 months. Normally I wouldn't give her the time of day, however this was an extraordinary circumstance. During our relationship, she had to hide me from her ex that she was living with and conversation was way more scarce than I would've liked. She said that he was controlling and violent, and she would hide me so he didn't find out and abuse her. With no proof other than her word, I gave her the benefit of the doubt externally, but internally juggled a million red flags. One day disappeared. It hurt for a few months but eventually I found H. 

My ex returned with a news article describing her ex who'd been arrested on kidnapping charges and various other charges. From the information provided, I found it to be true. And he had been physically abusing her over the last 5 months. This is meant to describe that she was gone but it wasn't her fault. When she did return I asked her where we stood and she said she's working on healing. I took that as maybe one day we'll try again but definitely not right now, which made it easy to not drop a bomb on her on day one and tell her about H.

I also did not tell H that my ex returned, mostly because I wasn't really sure what to do. My ex still rarely talked to me. I'd go 10-20 hours without hearing from her, whereas H talks to me day in day out, and we help each other through our mental struggles. Fast forward 2 days H asked me to play truth or dare. I said truth she asked me how many girls I was talking to. Online I have many female friends, and I was honest with her. I also told her she was the only one I was interested in. Sounds like a dumb excuse but I honestly forgot about my ex, because we rarely talk anyways. On my dare, H asked me for the tbh on my Snapchat story (knowing it would be a romantic gesture.) I knew my ex would see but I couldn't back down now. So I posted.

My ex saw it and she affirmed she had meant she wanted to work back towards a relationship with me. She was very upset Because she said she has always been cheated on, abused or at the very least always been th second option. I felt so very bad for her, and guilty I hadn't told her upfront, but I couldn't choose her over H. It was a very hard night. And I pleaded with her not to go, it hurt too much when she left the first time. I felt betrayed and broken. After a few hours, I told her I understood that she had just been forced against her will in a situation that was horrible to go through and that I wouldn't force her to stay. She deserves her freedom and it was the least I could do. She chose not to leave, much to my surprise, even though conversation has still been basically nothing, even days later.

I told H. about the situation as well that same night. She didn't have the most considerate response but I told her, look I put you out there for everyone to see that I'm focused on you and only you - a potential relationship, I just want to make sure I didn't do it for nothing and she said I didn't and that she just needs a little more time.

relationship_advice,"Hello, Reddit friends! I woke up from a dream today feeling confused and thinking of sharing this here. I just want to ask about the general opinion on this matter.

So here's the story [2015]: (Sorry, it'll be quite long.)I had a crush on a classmate in one of our subjects back in college. He was one year ahead of us, and the subject was a minor one, so we got a chance to get to know him. He's already a famous person on campus. But I never knew him until that day. We befriended him because my friends tease me about him since they know I have a crush on him. My friends agreed to be cupids for us. We became friends with his other friends too, especially his best friend. We get along, and he's the closest to my ideal type of man. He's sometimes childish, but tolerable. That was the first time I really fell in love with someone. Not that kind of first love or puppy love. I knew at that time it was mature and real.

I've had high school relationships, but they were never official because I didn't introduce the guys to my parents. I have this thought that 'the one I should introduce to my parents will be the one I will marry'. 

During those times, I showed how interested I was in him. I know he knows it. We go out and ask how the day was. Sharing personal stuff. And it came to a point where I was sure he also liked me.

After semester break, he did not contact me at all. I asked his best friend if he was able to contact him, and he said yes. My crush even greeted his best friend well during the holiday, but I did not. I tried reaching him but got no reply. That time, I knew he was slowly disappearing.

Classes resumed, and he was not our classmate anymore in any of our subjects. We only got to see him once in a while on campus and when friends planned to go out. We rarely communicated either, and I reasoned out that maybe he's focusing more on his studies because his subjects are all major now. But I was still hoping.

Then one night, his best friend chatted with me. The first conversation was just him asking me how I was. And it moved to the topic that he said to stop expecting from my crush. He said that he talked about it with him and that his crush just sees me as a 'sister'. He was too cowardly to talk with me about it, so he relayed it to his best friend. And my best friend relayed it to me. I was devastated. It was the most painful heartbreak I've had.

A week after that night, I was still in pain, and I wanted to talk to him and hear it from him. But there was no chance. I also did not see him on campus. He's not replying to my texts and chats. I really, really like him.

One slightly rainy night (again), my roommate and one of our friends wanted to go out for coffee and pizza, so we went to a coffee shop in town. Then there, we saw him with a girl sitting next to him, sharing earphones with each other, listening to music while having coffee. That was the most epic movie-like scene of my life. I don't really remember how I acted back then, but I remember the feeling of being betrayed and suffocated.

I talked about what happened that night with his best friend. And he said to me that he met the girl at a bar and was pursuing her. That was the moment it hit me to stop.

To move on, I need to hate him. I once said that I can't continue being friends with him, not at that time or in the future. Our friends understood that we couldn't be in the same room together. So whenever they want to get together, they plan separately for me and for him.

My crush and that girl became a couple. And I also entered into a relationship after that.

Last year, my friends randomly asked me if I was okay with including my crush in our group chats. He also wanted to reconnect with us. And I answered positively because I've moved on and it's been years since that thing happened to us. And so, we became friends again. We never talked about the past, and whenever I tried to incorporate it into the conversation, like reminding him how he ghosted me, he would always dog it.

Now, we're both single and still friends.

And today, I dreamed of him. I rarely remember my dreams, so I'm really thinking about this one.The dream: we are having a get-together. He mentioned that he is pursuing someone that he really likes. He even said that 'he can't have anyone but her'. In my dream, I was hurt because I still liked him.

I'm confused; I don't like him anymore. I'm completely fine with being friends with him. Is it something I need to address with him because we had some unfinished business before? Is it my subconscious telling me that I am still not okay with what he did and somehow wants to get closure?

relationship_advice,"Hello Reddit! I have a rather unique dilemma, and I'm posting the short(er) version here. I have a more detailed post on my profile in case anyone wants more details; I just wanted to try to cut down on the length some (':

Forewarning: I'm afraid this turned out to be a pretty lengthy post, but I'll do my best to summarize in the tldr below. 

- I (26f) reconnected with and caught feelings for my old high-school friend (24m), and we had even begun talks of marriage, moving in together and building a life together, when he found out that his ex (22f) was pregnant; and everything fell apart. -

-
    Essentially, this last year I went through an initially-wonderful experience of reconnecting with a dear old school friend I'd lost touch with after dissolving most of my socials. 
    We were close friends in high-school during the single year I lived there with my aunt and uncle. I believe we definitely trauma-bonded due to both of us being struggling unstable teens at the time. He was one of my best friends, and I'll always care about him. 

   I moved back home after my senior year, so we weren't able to be as close as before. Years passed and we grew apart, as happens with life. We kept in distant scattered communication for a few more years, until I went through a life-altering event and basically fell off the face of the earth. I deleted all of my social medias and had my number changed, and I lost contact with him and many others.  

Skip forward to 2021, when out of nowhere he snapped me on my only remaining social. We picked right back up to friendly messages here and there, but we never really caught up or regained that initial closeness until fall of 2022. 
   He'd grown into a really wonderful man, and I was so proud of him and happy for how his life turned out. 
   We are both acknowledged lousy texters, but we'd grown to the point where we were talking on the phone every spare moment we could for months because we enjoyed each other's company so much. 
   During one of those calls, he ended up confessing some things to me that took me for a loop. 
   Apparently, during HS, he'd had a pretty big crush on me. I tend to be a little oblivious about things like this, and when he asked me if I ever suspected, I admitted that I had sometimes wondered if he might have a slight crush on me, but he had never said anything. He laughed at that, and said ""Just a crush?! Okay, from the woman that made me believe in love in the first place!"" 

   He told me he'd always greatly regretted not being brave enough to ask me to prom first, and being beat to the punch by another friend of mine. To the point that ever since then, he said that whenever he was afraid or intimidated by something, he would think back to his regret, say ""fuck it"" and go for it. He said it helped push him to where he is today and changed his mindset for the longterm. 
   More came out over the fall, and I was just reeling. I'd apparently played a role in his first marriage with ex-wife. He said she looked kind of like me (we do bare a passing resemblance) and even her wit and personality reminded him of me. Even then, he said he held off on marrying her for years during my absence, because he was foolishly  holding out hope that ""we would somehow come back into contact again"". He even insinuated that I played a small role in their divorce. 
   When he found his old snap login and pass this last year, he said he ""nearly cried when [I] replied."" 
   
   I was shocked by how suddenly I couldn't get him out of my head, but we were both so excited and happy. He constantly pushed for me to move back out to his state, and move in with him, but I wanted to take things slowly. We had a trip planned for January on which I planned to confess to him the depth of what I was feeling too. He was already planning a future for us, mentioned 'finally marrying me' multiple times, and we were both on cloud nine. Everything felt like some cheesy Hallmark movie. 
   And then at the end of November, out of the blue he went silent. 

   He told me that he'd gotten some news and needed some time alone. I was super concerned at first, and suddenly terrified that something had happened that would affect us. My therapist told me at the time not to get ahead of myself and assume the worst, when I mentioned that I was worried that something had happened and we would have to break up before we were ever officially together. 
   Well, a few days after the initial silence, he confirmed my worst fears. Apparently his ex-girlfriend was pregnant with his child. 
   He'd mentioned her before briefly; that they'd dated a short time, and she was in love with him. He said he'd always regret breaking her heart when he dumped her, because she was a sweet girl, but he said he ""just never saw himself marrying her."" Since he knew that she wanted to marry him and have children together (he wasn't sure at the time we were talking that he even wanted to have children ever) he decided that breaking up was the right thing to do. 

   I asked if they were planning on getting back together now for the child, and he said ""I honestly do not know what we are doing, what I am doing, how I feel, I am really just freaking out!"" 
   When I asked if he wanted to call off our trip in a month, he said ""I hate to say it, but I think we should… I am so sorry. I don’t know what I am going to do for money, what I’m going to do for anything."" We both said we were sorry. I was too stunned to cry yet. 
He answered ""I haven’t stopped crying for like three days. I am straight up panicking.. I feel like my future just shattered. My future with money, my future ideologies, my core values, my future with you.""
   When I asked how I could be there for him or support him through this, he said ""I hate to say this because it hurts me so much, but until I can figure my life out can we revert back to just friends?""

   I agreed of course, and we fell into a tense and unhappy sporadic discourse. Our messages went from months of ""You make me happier than you could ever know; my friendship will never go."" and- ""Ok Sweetheart! You are the woman of my dreams! I am so so happy I met you. I spend every night dreaming of you, and everything you mean to me!"" To very brief few-word sentences, and I was devastated. 

   He called me on my birthday, and I'd missed his voice so much; but our conversation was short because I was in the midst of helping a coworker out of a bad situation (another story). When I asked him what he wanted from me going forward, he said ""I would like to be able to still text, be friends, and talk. I am probably going to be a little more distant.""

   Well, the distance was killing me, and I ended up getting nosy and opening up an old account on facebook to see how he was doing, and if he was struggling half as much as I was. I found that he'd been tagging one girl a lot, and I assumed that was the ex he'd gotten pregnant. Well, I'm a sucker for pain I guess, because I went to check her account. And found out there, from her profile, that they were apparently back together officially. 
   I spent most of the winter crying over him. I know he's trying to do what he believes to be the Right thing, but I still felt so discarded and wounded. I'd been so happy for a while; and in just two weeks or less he was suddenly back with her, and I was crying alone again. 

   In January I had mostly come to terms with things, and though it all still hurt so terribly (I think he was my first real romantic heartbreak) I had accepted that I simply had no choice in the matter, and that he'd made his decision.
   At the end of the month he reached out though, and tried to resume texting like old friends, as though nothing had even happened. He apologized for vanishing for so long, and how he felt like an awful friend for 'just stopping talking'. He said ""I hope you know that I am still and always will be your friend.""  I thanked him, said Ditto, and wished him all the best. I was entirely ready, though heartbroken, for that to be our last conversation. He replied ""I would still like to be able to talk... I miss our talks like crazy!"" 
   When I said that I missed it too, but wasn't sure if it was a good idea anymore, he seemed confused. He said ""Why is that?"" Um...?
   I put it in plain terms and asked how he thought that talking to someone that he'd professed to be in love with since high-school, and had altered the course of his life because of; would be fair or alright while he was in a serious committed relationship.
  His reply was ""I will never stop caring for you. You are my oldest, and best friend I've ever had. I don't think those feelings will ever go away.""
   I said that everything was still very raw for me, and asked him for some time to think on it. He told me to take as much time as I needed, and that he'd be there. 

   Well Reddit, there's my dilemma. 
   Over the next few months of grieving and trying to move on, I would occasionally check their pages, looking for the announcement I knew was coming. 
   He'd been reposting cool dad pages and videos with infants skydiving and other extreme stuff, so I assume he's come around to the idea of being a dad. If there's some small solace I can take from all of this, it's that at least he has the chance to experience that with her, because I know he probably never would have with me. 
   My therapist tried to tell me that we could always attempt a distant friendship again with strong boundaries in place once more time had passed and feelings had settled.

   Last week I pulled the app up to see an engagement announcement. The tears came right back.
   I have entirely accepted that this situation is real and that door is closed. The idea of watching their happy life and family however just makes my heart hurt all over again, and I'm ready for this chapter to be over. 
   He said to me once that he ""Wasn't going another 6 weeks, let alone another 6 months without seeing me again."" Well, it will be 6 months as of this May since we last really talked, and I figure that I owe him a response, one way or another. 

   I still worry about an attempted friendship of any sort causing problems for their marriage, and I know that if I were in the girl's shoes, I would probably not feel comfortable or happy with him talking to his old flame. She does seem like a sweet young woman. I feel terrible for her too, but at least I know she has someone to hold her and comfort her. 

   So Reddit, with the context above, do you think any form of a friendship is still even possible, or plausible?  Or should I entirely cut myself out of his life and go our separate ways. Do you have any advice on what to say to him, or do? I want to reply within the next week, I just don't know what to say or how I'm going to get through it. 

TLDR: A close old friendship was revealed to be something more intense, and feelings escalated fast. His ex popped up pregnant a few months in and he ended things with us. I found out they were back together, and now even engaged. He still wants to maintain a friendship, but I don't know if that's a good idea given our history and the nature of his relationship. What should I tell him/do?

Well I lost my virginity to him in 10th grade as well. I fell in love with him and he gave me so much love. Broke up once and got back together. During 2020 it wasn’t the best for us. Throughout the years he’s always been sweet, caring and thoughtful to where he remembers my favorite things and what can make me feel better. Our intimate life was great til now, we no longer have the time or place to be intimate and I miss that. I’ve told him and he’s felt the same way but nothings been done. He can be lazy and we go to a cal state uni together but he doesn’t put in any efforts. He doesn’t really take care of himself in a way were I complain for him to do things as if I were his mom. He’s very supportive and comforting when I need his company but than those moments where I feel unhappy because it’s difficult for me to understand why he can’t write me letters like how he used to or get me any flowers. I’ve shared how that means so much to me and how special it makes me feel to get handwritten notes and flowers and gifts but its not only about the gifts, their also the dates we share. They arnt always carefully planned by him and they come naturally but it’s hard to make dates based on school. However he doesn’t even put any efforts into school either. I make plans most of the time but since he doesn’t have a car yet we use the bus or an Uber. He has a drivers license and a car but is unable to drive it because his parents tell him to get a job first. I have my 3+ month birth control but we have no activity sometimes and i respect that but he can’t consider condoms. This birth control kind of changes me mentally and physically. I love him but at the same time what if it’s just me loving being loved?

relationship_advice,"Today started with what seemed like a very minor argument. Not something I foresaw getting worse at all.

Somehow it escalated into an argument. 

I’m big at crying when I become upset. Not huge at yelling or screaming. 

My partner on the other hand regularly raises his voice when he becomes upset whether it’s in our relationship or at innate objects. 

It’s not always yelling but it is usually raising his voice. Tonight he suddenly started raising his voice at me and when I asked why he was raising his voice. 

He got louder and said “F*** you. F*** off. I’m allowed to have emotional reactions.” 

He told me again “F*** you.” 

When I stated that he wasn’t being kind and showing he cared for me talking to me like that. 

I just feel like I need advice on how to make it clear even if he thinks that’s an acceptable emotional reaction.

relationship_advice,"We are about 9 years apart. She likes to settle down with in 1-2 years. Age difference is not really a problem for me. But it is obvious that we feel like in different life stages.
We have been seeing each other a year and a half. We are getting along pretty well going on small trips eating out etc.

There are couple of  problems. We work in the same company and same floor. But we dont really work directly. So if this doesn’t work out, there will be inevitable awkwardness.
Second problem is, people around us quite judgmental, especially my parents. My father stopped talking to my sister , cause she got married without his blessing(due to the groom ‘s religion). So i think i will get some shit from parents because of the age difference.  Maybe even be in the same position that my sister is in. 

I obviously at one point I will settle down, get married, have child etc. I am not sure if I will get to that place within one or two years. But doing that now would feel like I am rushing. 

Deep down, it feels like she would settle down with anyone she gets along anyway. So that I am not sure if she is really in love. 

I would consider job opportunities located abroad. She is quite hesitant to move abroad since she has a good career within the company. Maybe she would do it if we’re married.

Other than that, we are good, we don’t fight. We are a happy couple.We could live peacefully if were living under the same roof. She is supportive in general.  Not sure how things would be down the road, when she is in menopause or when we are older etc. so I may not be seeing things.
In general, I think it is normal that she feels like. Her biological clock is ticking. 
On the other hand , I dont want to throw away our relationship because I can’t make up my mind right now, also I can’t guarantee settling down with in 2 years, so that I also don’t want to waste her time. Since we have been together about a year and a half, she thinks it is enough time for someone to get to know someone to settle down with.

Am I stressing out for nothing? 
Would all these things matter down the road ? 
Is the age difference always be a problem?

relationship_advice,"Hello, kind strangers of reddit! After lurking for months, I‘ve decided to make my first post. 
Some background info: Me and my bf have been dating for a little over a year and are long distance, living in two separate european countries. We‘ve had plenty of opportunities to visit and they were all great, so no issues there.

Now onto what’s been bothering me for quite a bit: For as long as I‘ve known him (which is roughly 3 years), he has always been quite a forgetful person. I noticed it properly when we started dating and at first was really alarmed because I thought he didn’t care about me enough to remember small things. He never forgot about dates we planned or major things like that. 

I soon realized he wasn’t just forgetful like that with me (which ironically calmed me down a bit) but with friends and family too, where he would forget the occasional birthday or mix up the times when he was supposed to meet up with someone, showing up earlier or later.

Interestingly enough however, he also tends to remember very small (and to me often seemingly ""insignificant"") bits from months or sometimes years ago, where I was the one to have forgotten completely. 

He does have a lot on his plate due to work and family related issues and he also is very much a person that lives ""day by day"". That in and by itself is somewhat of a foreign concept to me since I overthink a lot and like everything planned out in advance to soothe any possible anxieties. 

Whenever he forgets something I told him (e.g. having told him about my plans the night prior and then him forgetting significant parts of it the following night), I get noticeably hurt. Mainly I think, because I usually remember even the smallest details of what he tells me, so I have a hard time understanding how it’s difficult for him.

Now I don’t consider breaking up over this, as he is great outside of this but I was hoping to get some advice on how to handle these situations and maybe hear from people who experienced similar things.

Thanks for reading.

relationship_advice,"I have been with my bf for 6 months. I’ve been in college the entire time we’ve been together and I consider myself to be very career driven. 
I always talk about my dream job, how I wanna use my job to help others, why it’s so important to me, and the steps I’m going to take to get there.
With the semester coming to a close, Im finally applying places. Every time i get an interview somewhere I tell him and my entire family about it, what I would be doing, and how this would help me reach my main goal.
I know this might sound excessive, but im also a single parent, and so this is very important to me. I’ve worked extremely hard to get here and I’m really proud of what I’ve accomplished while also being a parent, and partner.

When i tell him about these things (interviews, my goals, my dream career, etc) he always responded with things like “woowww.” Or “nice.” Which kinda made me feel a little sad because I’m so passionate about it and he seems uninterested when I bring it up.

Today I got an interview for an amazing job that would bring me so close to what my main goal is, and I didn’t think I’d be able to get an interview for something like this since im fresh out of college.
When I told him that I would be an accountant (literally my major is accounting) he said “what’s that?”
I was confused and said “it’s what my goal was.. accountant and eventually a cpa.”
He said “what’s an accountant even do?” 
I explained and then said “you really never thought to look into what I wanna do? I talk about it all the time.” 
He got defensive and said he just never thought about it, and didn’t see why I was upset by it.

Sorry in advance, english is not my first language 
So I (22F) was in a really crapy relationship, he abused me  not only verbally, but sexually and messed up with my head a lot. 
I had to go to therapy for 1+ years so I could be strong enough to break up with him. Last year I finally broke up with him. 
It was so messed up that I got to the point where I was scared of answering texts, because he would se that I was online and would got angry at me, so naturally, I lost most of my friends. When I broke up with him the first thing that I did was get back in touch with all of the people I lost contact over the past 3 years, I explained the situation and I didn't hold back on what he did to me (srly guys, one time he threatened with posting videos he took of me (without my consent) on pornhub just so I wouldn't go to a party) I told a lot of people all of this things because honestly, everyone should know what kind of person he actually is. 
Fast foward to yesterday I saw that my ""friend"" tagged my ex on a post on facebook, the post was something about going out to a bar, anyways I texted her and asked her what's up with that, the onky thing she told me was ""I knew you would find out eventually"". I felt so hurt that I immediately deleted her contact information and did the same on facebook. 
Was I too harsh?

relationship_advice,"I started dating this woman(lets call her “MJ”) a few months ago through tinder. Honestly its taken me a long time to attempt a new relationship since my last one crushed me but she was everything i’ve been waiting for. During our first date me and MJ hit it off really well and i was so hopeful for our relationship. We were honest about our ex’s, she had been cheated on, my ex lied and then left me. We kinda connected and opening up was nice.  We were texting everyday for a month, and had a few dates that were a mix of fun and productive, not all were “fun” but we were making strides towards trust and understanding each other and starting to get closer. 

Long story short, we had a bad date, i brought food to her place and we smoked weed together. I thought the date was alright, she had voiced some concerns about me comparing my family dynamic to an ex of hers, this didn’t sit well with me because my family isn’t that bad but I did see where she was coming from with the recent family tension I had told her about, as a result my dismissive reaction only put tension in the air. We smoked and then just kinda enjoyed each others company for an hour. I fell asleep for a little bit. And when i woke up she was asking me to leave. I wasn’t in the best position to be driving home so I asked to stay but she was feeling uneasy, after strong arming me on it i got out but that interaction wasn’t pleasant for either of us. I decided to sleep it off in the car,my phone was dead. When I woke up I drove home at 4am and returned to find out she had texted me that she had been uncomfortable with me sticking around.

Now I understand there are psycho’s out there, but I know I’m not one of them so I didn’t think twice about what I was doing. Hindsight is 2020 and so I get how this could be scary for a woman. With everything said and done I felt like that wasn’t the best date but that it wasn’t the worst date, we would pull through and make adjustments and move forward. The next day she asked for space, I made apologies for my words and actions not realizing it’s effects at the time and my own follies. A few days go by I need my charger back and text her again about it. She leaves it on the porch but she is still avoiding me. After a few more days I text seeing how she’s doing and she tells me to stop pestering her. I follow up saying that I would appreciate some kind of info as to what’s up, she hadn’t told me what was wrong and so my mind is going a million miles an hour. I’m stressing because I really liked her and while she isn’t my only form of happiness she made me feel so much better. I was afraid, mostly because my ex broke my heart by ghosting me after asking for space. I was asking for a decision on what she wanted abut she wasn’t ready. 

She sent me a text Tuesday saying I was not being respectful of her request for space and she didn’t want to continue. I was letting my insecurities go to only exacerbate her natural need for space in a new relationship, it’s on me, I know. I told her I was disheartened by what I heard but that I would respect her wishes. I asked for the stuff I had left at her place back and she said she would text me on Thursday when I could come pick it up. Thursday has come and passed yet she hasn’t reached out. A part of me hopes she hasn’t reached out because she’s not sure breaking up is fully what she wants that she just needs the space to think things over, I haven’t attempted reaching out since and plan on holding off for at least another week and a half. 

Anyways, I was looking on relationship advice and I found this post made a month back, right when we were really falling for each other. The ages are the exact same and it’s chilling how similar the story matches both of us. In the post OP describes her new bf as someone who took a year off after his (white) ex broke his heart, and OP a black woman was cheated on by her ex/ some more stuff I’m not currently aware of. OP describes how she is afraid of screwing the relationship up because of traumas she isn’t ready to disclose yet, and at the same time feels she needs to fill some pretty hefty shoes. At this point I whole heartedly believe she posted that about us.

So now I don’t know what to do with this information and don’t know what would be the best course of action. It hurts thinking she may have loved me cause I was honestly feeling like she was indifferent to me, a couple times I felt expected not appreciated like I was fighting this uphill battle for her reciprocation. Now that I’ve read this it makes so much sense that she was just being cautious and adding a little distance because she doesn’t know my intentions or how I react to conflict and she has a past that I thought I understood but I don’t think I do now. If she has trauma and fears it only makes me feel worse for that night because maybe I triggered her memory on something even though that wasn’t my intention. Not to mention I let my insecurities go to reinforce those fears. I didn’t mean to be overbearing because I was thinking it was all my fault, and I didn’t know she was worried about living up to my ex, I think she is amazing and she’s being to hard on herself. She is absolutely beautiful, sexy and on the inside exactly what I like most in women, and while my track record doesn’t seem to reinforce that statement I whole heartedly believe it. Rome wasn’t built in a day and while my ex meant a lot to me in the past, I recently see a future being built in a new vision, with this vision of MJ. And no the prospect of her traumas doesn’t turn me off, I’ve dated women with similar struggles in the past and it’s not something that’s a deal breaker to me, however knowing at least a little helps me understand where some things come from, not everyone’s the same so I need to just learn her specific quarks.

At some point I’ll need to get my stuff back, we will have to communicate at some point and a reality of either it’s over or it’s just beginning will set in. If she reaches out I don’t know if it would be good idea to bring up that I found the post, I could address the insecurities she has and really let her know they are so outlandish of her to believe but there is the caveat that she also mentions physical and mental abuse I wasn’t aware of. I don’t want to scare her away or put her in the position where she has to disclose information she isn’t ready to talk about if there is a chance we can try and save this. As it stands I think we are both hurting right now, and I want to believe neither of us really want to give up just yet, but the question is weather this impending vulnerability and wall of past pain is worth scaling.  I think it is, I think she is worth it, i just don’t know how to tell her she is. I really believe my actions that caused her to need space weren’t relationship ending worthy, so any thoughts on how going about getting her to give me a chance are appreciated.

relationship_advice,"We haven't been seeing other people for about 2 months now and suddenly he wants me to play hard to get. I don't see what's the point of that if he already knows that I'm clingy. ""Give me space"" or ""Don't give me so many compliments"" - these would have been okay, but he expects me to pretend I don't like him.

But when I was talking about how I'll wear my prettiest dress for our picnic, he said ""we don't need to impress each other"". If we don't need that, why would I suddenly need to act like I don't want him?

Also he's the type of a man who doesn't care. His ex girlfriend traveled to another country for work and he was like ""okay"" and they broke up. Or once I tried to make him jealous (back when we were seeing other people I asked another guy to give me a hickey just for that reason), didn't work and eventually he said if he's jealous he loses interest. This man just doesn't care.

Yesterday he was a bit drunk and he texted me saying it wouldn't hurt me if I ignored him for a day. When he sobered up he claimed it was just a joke, but I don't believe it. ""Schroedinger's joke"" maybe. I don't devote every second of my day to text him, but if I'm on my phone or it's nearby when he texts me, why wouldn't I answer? 

I'm scared if I play hard to get and ignore him, he will just go to another girl. I care about him and don't want it to happen. Or if I start giving ""I don't care"" energy, he will give it back to me and we will stop talking (we text all the time between meeting). Will tell him that today when I see him, but I don't wanna seem more desperate than I already look. How should I put this into words to not scare him away?

Also - how can I play hard to get without making it obvious that I'm faking it? How should I act today when I see him to show him that I'm upset and he has to impress me if he wants to keep me? I don't want it, but if he does...

He told me that within weeks of them dating she had sex with another guy (and he stayed) and that the reason they broke up was because she lied about who she was with and ended up cheating on him again with her coworker. There were way more instances where he was cheated on in between but in both relationships he's had, he has been cheated on. 

He also says that he sees himself from like an outside point of view? He told me that he was there physically talking to me but he wasn't there (I guess mentally?) The best he could describe it as was basically dissociation. I asked him if he was open to at least trying to talk to me in a romantic way or if he just wanted to remain as friends. He answered to being open to talking in a romantic way but clearly stated that he was emotionally unavailable. 

Fast forward through the months, we spend almost everyday together from going to the gym to staying at each others dorms until 4am. And during this time he begins to open up to me about his family, how his exes affected him and made him toxic, the negative thoughts he's been having, and we ended up getting to like second base. There was an instance though where he asked to talk to me and he stated that although he was enjoying our time together, he's not ready for a relationship. During that same talk he also said that he wouldn't get completely intimate with someone unless he was emotionally available and ready for that. He also stated that his toxic tendencies from his last relationship were coming up as well such as jealousy from other guys talking to me. This was a major factor for him because he doesn't like that feeling of jealousy and the negativity around that. And from there he just apologized, but I asked him, what is it that he wants to do then? I stated that my feelings for him are secure and that I'm all about him and that if he only wants to talk without a relationship I would do that or if he wants to cut contact I would completely understand too. He said that he would want to keep taking to me but he would feel selfish if he did knowing that he wouldn't put himself 100%.  As in he would only give 35% of himself to what we had, he used that number btw. I agreed to it because I love him.

A few weeks later we end up having sex and another time again, and during this era we were very close. At this point my hopes were high up, not about being in a relationship but because we had confirmed that we were exclusive to each other only. And also because I remembered he said that he would only get this intimate if he was emotionally there. But during this time it was hard for him to balance his time between schoolwork, gym and me. I didn't have a hard time balancing my schedule so I always offered to help him with his by asking to do homework together or suggesting different times. But he would always decline because he said he's not able to focus on work around me, so instead we would just hangout and it got him behind. I felt so bad and we did take a week of just studying but our relationship didn't change. 

Up until 2 weeks ago I noticed he got very distant. From not asking to hangout, declining my invitations, and lagging on messages for up to hours a day. It even got to their point where we wouldn't even kiss goodbye anymore because I just felt awkward and felt like I forcing him to kiss me. So I asked him why wouldn't he kiss me anymore and he replied by saying that he only did because it felt like a habit and he just went with it. Ouch. Days later with still minimal contact I end up asking him what's wrong. And he just states that he found himself ""getting too emotionally invested and then ends up becoming emotionally unstable with his feelings and being. He doesn't know if he has the energy to be dealing with himself right now""

I responded by telling him that I didn't mean to make him feel uncomfortable in any way and that my feelings for him are super genuine but that the sudden cut off confused and hurt me. Also that I felt like I could do so much for him in ways of supporting him and caring for him. He responded by saying that he agrees that I could do a lot for him too but that ""he doesn't have the resources right now or anytime son to be working on himself the way it would take for us to work. And that's where we left it at. He is an insecure person and I tried to reassure him as much as I could without overstepping boundaries. We have matching sweaters and he even has a small decor I gave him for his room. After days of no contact at all I saw that he ended up following 3 girls, two from his hometown and another that goes to our college. What does that mean? 

Today when we saw each other I talked to him like normal but we didn't walk together and it was just friendly. My one question was that did he want to remain friends or what was the relationship we have now? I asked him if he was okay with being friends and at least going to the gym together and he agreed but only if we went on his time. Later on I saw that he unfollowed two of the three girls he followed but I think it's because they didn't follow him back. But yeah I just feel completely heartbroken at the fact that he likes me but he doesn't want to be with me. 

I just want an outside perspective to at least give me advice on how to help him get to his 100%. Or is this one of the moments where someone pushes you away and they want you to prove to them that you like them? Should I still show my interest in him or distance myself to be aquaintances in math class? Or just completely cut each other off. Or if anyone knows a way where this can possibly work out I would really appreciate that too. Im so in love with him that any other male doesn't compete with him at all. I'm willing to wait as long as it takes. It's why I offered to be friends because I value him as a person and treasure our relationship so much. I just hope he understood how much he means to me and that he doesn't deserve how his exes treated him, I would treat him so well. Please help guys or at least read it :(

For backstory me and my boyfriend have been dating a little over 3 years. I moved in with him about 4 months ago and we had a long distance relationship. I only have one major thing for my relationships and it’s quality time. For about the past 2 months I’ve felt very neglected and I’ve voiced it to my boyfriend multiple times. Almost everyday my boyfriend gets home at 3PM and plays video games nonstop till 2AM (he’s currently gaming even now). After he games he goes straight to sleep. Sometimes when I ask him to hang out he’ll even reject me to continue gaming. I feel like I’m starting to fall out of love and talking to him about it doesn’t seem to change anything.

Backstory:
 I met this girl almost three years ago, and we really hit it off the first time we met. So, I pretty much spent the whole summer with her, and we fell really hard for each other. Then, I went to do my mandatory military service, and she helped me through it because I really hated it. I'd rather do something useful with my life.

After finishing my service in the winter, I had around eight months before school started, so I spent almost all of that time with her. I got to know her family and got really close to them, especially her mom and her siblings, except the oldest - something went wrong with her. So, after spending all that time, my school eventually started, and I'm studying something that involves data and programming (trying to stay semi-anonymous as she reads these). Then we kind of fell off, simply because I had no time after school, going to the gym, and dealing with life. But at one point, when I started to schedule my stuff and got my ADHD diagnosis and medication, it was due to her forcing me to go tested (really grateful for this).

I come from a family where you were left to fend for yourself, and I never really had a real connection with my family. But it had its perks. I turned out mentally tough and remained hopeful and positive about life, which can't be said about all of my siblings. But I never really had to worry financially, as my dad always made enough money so that I had all the toys and games as a kid (this will be important later).

I was really obese at one point, then fell in love with the gym and got kinda fit. After this transformation, girls started noticing me, and it was a really weird feeling because when I was fat, girls never really even talked to me.

She has a few rare medical conditions that make her day-to-day life really hard, and doctors here don't really know how to deal with these conditions. So, she has to literally fight with doctors to get her medications so she can live, and these visits to the doctors were kind of expensive. She and her family were really poor, so of course, I helped her financially and mentally. Also, her previous relationships were really toxic, so it was new to her that somebody would really be there for her just because they cared. Somewhere between starting my school and us starting to hang again, she met this dude that she spent her time with, and the dude got really mad and started threatening her and her family, which made me go red, and I really wanted to hurt the dude. But after getting calm, I realized I could ruin his life without myself doing anything. So, he was involved with some shady business, and luckily, I knew really bad people through my brothers and friends, and he had spilled the beans on their operations.

So, knowing that, I went to his friends and told them that he must leave her alone, or I would inform the cops on their little business, and that was the last thing they wanted to happen. Then they realized how fucking crazy their friend was. His friends gave him something that he deserved and forced him to move out of the city. (By the way, it felt like a fucking superhero standing there explaining the situation to his friends in front of him.)

Backstory ends.

?:
So we have been together through a lot, and both of us have grown as humans. I have learned to trust people and let others help me, and I also give credit to her that I forgave my parents for not being there for me. And she has learned that people are not always that bad, and after the situation above was done, she slowly started to trust men again

Now:
She is going through a rough phase, both mentally and financially, and needs help quite often. However, I have my own struggles with life, making it hard to be there for her.

Due to her situation, she is not able to do much more than smoke or waste time, and because of this, our sex life is pretty much non-existent. This would not be that big of a deal to me normally, but she and I have realized it's a way for us to release built-up pressure between us.

Our relationship has now reached a point where it's pretty much one-sided. I help her financially, clean, or take out the trash, etc. She is supposed to graduate in winter, and things should start to get better from there, but I have no idea if I can get through this rough patch.

At this point, she has racked up a pretty large debt to me, and I have given her a long time to pay it back because I really don't have the need for money currently.

TLDR: I would do and have done everything for this girl, but I'm not sure if I'm able to make it through this rough patch.

relationship_advice,"Hi! I’m a female in mid-twenties dating a guy five years older than me. About six months. It’s going very well and I’d say we are both very confident in the relationship and each other. We’re both from the same region, background, have a ton in common, same spiritual values, some mutual friends, etc. As title mentions, I have a much higher sex drive than he does. I don’t view this as a deal breaker, but it was a little weird for me as I’ve adjusted. It was definitely a hit to my self-esteem for a bit while we were early in our relationship and I didn’t feel as comfortable inquiring about the lack of sexual activities and I perceived it as him not being interested in me and sort of questioned myself/the relationship (not saying that’s healthy of me whatsoever). He compliments me and says he’s physically attracted to me. Any advice on getting used to your boyfriend not wanting sex as much as you’d expect? Anyone gone through similar experiences? I have zero desire for an open relationship or anything like that. Not attracted to anyone else and don’t have any concern I’d ever look elsewhere to fix the urge, but wondering how others have handled it. Oddly enough, I think “handling it myself” actually makes my sex drive higher.

My partner (22M) and I (23F) have been together for almost 6 years. We have gone through so much together, made beautiful memories, and began starting our lives together. We recently moved into our own apartment and it was going fantastic. I am currently in school and have a lot of responsibilities with that so I am often studying until late at night. The only time we really spend quality time together is on the weekends. Because of this, our sex life has come to a stalemate. I have been so stressed and find it hard to be in the mood when my brain is so loud. He is a very sexual person. It’s something he needs in order to feel connected which I totally understand. This has led him to the decision that he wants to try an open relationship so he can be happy and I could even experiment too (mind you we tried before and he was the one that stopped it). I hesitantly agreed because even though I never want to sleep with someone else nor have him do it, I’d rather get over the fact that I’m not comfortable with it so he can be happy. I realize I haven’t been good at providing what he needs lately. And on top of that he is into a lot of stuff I just am not interested in ever trying. I’m just so anxious about this.

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend get's mad when I don't kiss him or hug him, and no we haven't been intimate in a long time either because I've just personally been not into it. At first I thought it was me because I've been going through a lot emotionally. I also just sometimes thinking I'm growing out of our relationship and I think it's a lot to do with behavior like this.

I'm not sure if there's anyone else like this in their relationships but, I often don't like to be touched. That is any sort of physical contact gives me sensory overload I get so uncomfortable. Nothing to do with anyone but its a me thing which I think has a lot to do with trauma I experienced when I was younger. We've been together for 3 years or so and you think by now he'd understand sometimes I just don't want to be touched at all. He often just "" expects "" things. Without asking he'll just kiss my forehead or my cheek then shove his face into mine expecting the same. For awhile I felt some sort of obligation to reciprocate it and no I haven't always felt this way as I know that is something normal in a lot of relationships. If I'm being honest, I still feel like I have to reciprocate it because I don't want to deal with the repercussions. I get so overstimulated that I feel like my skin is crawling.

For example tonight he said he was going to the gym and comes and kisses my forehead then shoves his face into mine expecting a kiss on the cheek back and I pushed his face away more than one time telling him excuse me and no. He immediately got offended and asked why and I said I just didn't want to and he kept pushing the fact and asked why. I proceeded to tell him that I shouldn't need a reason to not and with an attitude I got "" really just to give me a kiss on the cheek "" and he immediately got mad at me and slammed all the doors and left. In other situations he's just mocked me then played stupid when he realized I was upset. I don't think he really takes my feelings into consideration. There's been times where he tries to kiss me multiple times on the cheek and on my neck and I tell him no and he proceeds to keep doing it when I'm very uncomfortable.

Behavior like this turns me off. I can't tell you how much I've constantly been at war with myself feeling like I shouldn't be feeling like this and maybe I'm just overreacting. He's in general a nice guy but behavior like this also makes me not even want to kiss him when I am feeling okay with it.

relationship_advice,"I 26F have been dating my boyfriend 26M for almost 3 years and I feel like he’s losing interest in me, he doesn’t enjoy spending quality time with me anymore as when I go over to his house, he’d rather sit on his computer or play on his PlayStation with his friends. He doesn’t want to talk about anything to do with us having a future together, for example I’ve brought up us moving in together at some point and every time he shuts it down (for context I’m currently living with my brother and his girlfriend as I was living alone but had some struggles with my mental health and my boyfriend still lives at home with his parents so I can understand how moving into his own place would be a scary step but it’s been three years and I feel like that’s the next step our relationship needs. also his family hates me which makes staying there super awkward).I feel like I’m not a priority in his life anymore as he is able to find time for everything else except spending time with me. Over the weekend I was staying at his house and I was mostly left sitting in his room alone while he was out doing other things like selling yugioh cards and streaming on twitch, it’s been this way for a while but this weekend it felt like he was actively trying to not spend time with me, when I brought this up he denied it at first and gave me a speech about how busy he is. I could understand that, he does work a lot except he always seems to have time for everything else in his life but me, he ended up saying he didn’t want to spend time with me because I was being “pissy” that weekend. I admit I was a bit snippy as I had just gotten my period and was in a lot of pain, but I didn’t think that I was that bad that he couldn’t be around me when I was mostly snippy about him not spending time with me. I brought up that he had bought a game weeks ago that he said we would play together and he promised me that we would play it multiple times but it never happened, he then aggressively grabbed the game and through it down and said “fine we’ll pay the game “ as if that’s what I wanted, he then got more angry at me because he couldn’t understand why I was so upset at the fact he got angry at the idea of spending time with me we argued some more but it ending up with him cuddling me and the subject was dropped. The next day he spent a bit of time playing that game with me before going off to do his own thing and then stream, he told me he was only going to stream for an hour and that after we would play a different game, that’s not what happened he ended up streaming for over 2 hours and then after that said he was too tired and wanted to go to bed as he had to go to work the next day. I didn’t make a big fuss about this but it hurt me. I ended up laying awake unable to stop thinking about it and I let my paranoia get the best of me and I went through his phone. I checked his Twitter and his instagram which was mostly just pron this hurt me a bit but I didn’t really see it as a huge issue as I feel that’s typical of most guys, I was upset however that I saw he had reactivated his tinder account a few months prior while we were broken up for a few days. I checked his tinder and there were no messages at the time but there were a couple of matches. I should’ve left it at that because I don’t think I really wanted to know we were technically broken up so it’s his business but I still couldn’t sleep. I didn’t know how else to find any thing so I thought maybe he would’ve talked about it with his friends if he had done anything, I didn’t find anything about that but I did find some pretty hurtful things he had said about me to his friends with them chiming in, this also hurt because his friends have always been nice to me in person. I ended up admitting to going through his phone as I know it wasn’t the right thing to do secretly but he has gone through my phone in the past as well. He was really angry that I had gone through his phone and i apologised and told him that I was just scared that he was losing interest and that I was worried it might be because he had found someone else, he got more angry and at some point said “the more you dig the more you find” after he said that everything else was kind of a blur he saw my face and said “not like that” like in the way I was thinking but I’m struggling to figure out what he meant by that, I ended up crying myself to sleep with him cuddling me .It’s the next day, I left his house early in the morning and as I was leaving he kissed me and told me he loved me I told him I loved him too but I’m home now and I still feel uneasy.

relationship_advice,"Like the Tittle stated me and my best friend who a love to death, have been spending less time together this past year mainly due to her entering a new relationship and I’m so happy for her, but the down side is we spend less time together. We’ve been roommates for about 3-4 years and I’ve never felt so comfortable around some one.

The problem for me is that with her spending most of her time at her girlfriends I’m the one who cleans the house and does the dishes and use our groceries( that we spilt). I usually see her 2-3 days out of the week. I feel the distance as of late and feel that it’s getting farther. 

There was two instance were I didn’t see her for a whole week and one of the days included my fathers death anniversary, which lowkey rubbed me the wrong way. Granted we did have a conversation about the distance and the anniversary, but it doesn’t feel as though much has changed.  We don’t spend much quality time together any more in which we both are engaged. Most the time it’s us doing something like school work with the tv in the back. 

also I’d feels as if she doesn’t want to really live we’re we live. When I’m gone home to family she basically lives at her significant others place till I come back ,and then she actually stays at our place. I feel as though I am the only thing tethering her to where we live.

My question is are these valid reasons for moving out or am I just butt hurt .

relationship_advice,"I’ve been seeing a new guy recently, but I’m feeling a little off put by something he just revealed to me. I had him over tonight and lost track of time so he ended up leaving way later than I had originally expected. As he was about to walk at the door I made a comment on how I was tired, but still had to take a shower and get ready for work tomorrow. He then asked if I shower everyday, which I do, and he seemed shocked by this. So obviously I asked him how often he showers and this man proceeds to tell me that he only showers 2 days a week…. I know that showering every day may not be necessary, but 2 days a week? He lives an exceptionally healthy lifestyle, always looks put together, smells fresh, and has good dental hygiene, so I’ve been under the impression that he’s a pretty hygienic guy. But be honest, is 2 days a week a little slim? I mean how often do you guys shower? Lmao.

relationship_advice,"Hi, okay! While this one is a hard one and can include a lot of insecurity, doubt, and confusion, I need a little bit of advice. My (24f) boyfriend (27M) and I have been together for about a year. We both come with history, of course, that does not involve infidelity but a lot of broken trust and betrayal. We also both come from a background where we were in university and dated along those lines. He chose to focus on school, so his experience involves hookups and platonic relationships in that sense while I was in a long-term relationship that was extremely toxic and borderline abusive with me on the receiving end with a few hook-up stories to tell once that ended before I met my current boyfriend. 

Our relationship is still pretty fresh and we are both working on how to better communicate/comfort each other while both have an understanding that we are building a relationship for the future. We are also both pretty dramatic(in the sense that we may exaggerate when story telling or expressing emotions), enjoy a good laugh, so our relationship involves a lot of playful banter and we especially try to and have ended up in situations where we have had to explain that we are joking and mean no harm. We both for sure use comedy as a means for coping. I can have a complete shit day and still laugh it off and vice versa. 

Okay, so recently my boyfriend has expressed some scenarios of me cheating on him that are to the extreme level. While I can acknowledge that this is a common fear and due to how we communicate in joking terms, it is most likely exaggerated, I still have to acknowledge that this is a real fear and would like to reassure him that I would not do that. We both come from parents that are in broken relationships and have shared to each other that this is not something we want when involving marriage and children. We all the time call each other and tell each other “favorite person,” “best friend” and “I don’t want you to be my baby mama/daddy.” 

A good example is that he mentioned giving me a key to his place, but he immediately backed down and expressed, “no way. My hugest fear is that you’ll cheat on me in my house.” And honestly, all that I could say in response was, “woah there. That would be extremely messed up of me.” And that is because I completely believe that that would be an action of complete disrespect. It does not align with my morals and I am in just complete utter shock when I hear stories that go along those lines and I believe that he believes me when I express that. 

So the advice that i am seeking in this matter is, how can I better reassure him and acknowledge his feelings? This is a common fear for anyone. Myself included. I obviously am scared that he would do something along the same lines to me. He is someone very important to me and I value and respect him so much that I wouldn’t want to push his feelings to the side either. I know that the exaggeration of me doing something in his house is not a true fear of his and more so a hypothetical that of course could happen. I sorta kinda just tell him that that is insane and that I would never. Also, I am not in any way offended that he won’t give me a key to his place. I would have politely declined prior to his comment because I genuinely believe that it is too soon, for me, considering my history and if I want to be fair to him. Also, I know that if I were to ask for a key to his place, the next time we saw each other, he would have it ready for me.

I guess what I am asking is: What is something that I could say that I can reassure him and hear him rather than brush him off or give him the impression that he is annoying me when that is not that case at all? I really don’t want him to think that I don’t care and am trying to switch the subject. I want to make sure he feels heard because he shows me in several ways how he feels about me and values me. I just want to make sure that I am doing the same for him and when he brings up this fear of me cheating on him, I’d rather comfort him than say things that could be considered gaslighting or dismissive.",0,How do I (24f) reassure my partner (27M) that I would not cheat on them?,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8866586,1682487887,0,1682487899,1682487900,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,15,790

relationship_advice,"Not sorry for the long post. Trying to provide as much info as possible to get the most insightful feedback. 

Background:

I have always had a job since I started undergrad when I was 17. I completed my MBA in 2 years while working FT. I currently own three rental units (important for later). 

For the duration of this relationship, I have covered 80-90% of the expenses (important for context). She has worked about ~2-3 years part time during this same period since she was studying for medical entrance exams/boards/ being a full time student. She shares what/when she can and is generally loving/caring/supportive as a partner.

We could have lived together as I have my own place but she wanted to have income to contribute and did not want to be dependent on me to provide things for her so she chose to stay home with her parents. 

Now that she is about to graduate and already secured a job offer, I have been looking to find a place together. She has not contributed much effort in this search as I am more experienced and have lived alone/delt with both landlords and tenants while she has only stayed home with her parents. 

Here is where the argument started - 

My parents (imagine **extremely** frugal immigrants) offered to help me pay for the down payment for a condo instead of renting. The idea was that I would take a no-interest loan from my ""inheritance"" (so it would technically be my money) but I would still have to ""pay it back"" to replenish the account. I would pay the difference from what I receive from my parents and what the property would cost. 

I told my SO this and asked how would she want to split the equity for this hypothetical property?

The equity question is important for me to address because I watched my brother/friend struggle with this issue during their divorce. She is aware of this because I have brought this up on multiple occasions and told him that I would want a prenup to secure my current assets despite the fact that she will be making much for than me. 

She told me that she wanted to split the equity for the property 50/50 and would only reimburse me back for half of the difference I contribute outside the ""loan"" from my parents. When I asked how that made sense because I would technically be paying the full down payment upfront, I was told it does not make sense for her to split the inheritance portion since I ""haven't earned it"". I was also told that my questioning the 50/50 split ""drove the point home"" for her that I am ""inherently selfish"" (or inherently hold selfish tendencies). Her position is that if I can't bring myself to share everything 50/50 or have a 50/50 mindset, what's the point of being married? 

As much as I love her and see her as an equal partner, it's easy to want 50/50 when you are not offering anything in return. Her follow up comments about how it ""solidified"" how I am ~""selfish"" really broke my heart.

He was an amazing dad and did everything he could to provide for me and eventually them when he fought for years in court to get my siblings back. Unfortunately for my dad, I was the only child he was positive was his, due to the circumstances surrounding our conceptions. He’s also remained adamant that we are his though regardless of blood.

Anyways, yesterday my dad was in a car accident. He was rushed to hospital, needed surgery and a blood transfusion but is going to make a full recovery. While I was at the hospital today, the surgeon came in for a review and jokingly told me dad he should feel special as he has a very rare blood type AB Neg.. 

These words hit my like a bus… my egg donor is O Pos so are all my siblings. There is no possible way we are children, how do I tell him? I can’t keep this from him and I know his stance, he says he doesn’t care but I know it’s going to crush him. Even if he publicly acts like everything is ok. 

I’m so mad, my dad is the best man I’ve met. He gave me every opportunity he could.. he’ll always be my dad! But how could my egg donor do this to him?! She’s been lying for over 3 decades. I’ve never liked her but now it’s hate.

relationship_advice," I'm (24 F) in grad school, and I work as a TA (teaching assistant). I teach the lab part of a class that undergrads take, and I have a main class I run, then I co-TA another section (for this section I basically assist another TA in running the lab, I am not the one who's ""in charge""). In the section I co-TA, I am in an uncomfortable situation with one (20s M) of my students. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or if I should do anything about it, which why I'm posting on here.

The student in question keeps asking me questions even though I am the co-TA and only ever asks me questions. He has never approached the main TA for any of his questions or concerns even when she's not doing anything. He will ask the same questions over and over again even after we've ran through them several times. He will finish his work but come back to ask the same questions and double check. This takes a lot of my time and effort, especially when he installs himself in my desk for half of the time required to do the work. At first I thought he was just an overachiever or an anxious student but he doesn't seem to care much about the actual work, he just wants me to explain it to him over and over again. Whenever he comes to ask questions or to overview his work, he kind of... oversteps normal physical boundaries and will stand uncomfortably close to me.

I also catch him staring a lot during class, which again might be nothing but in the context of everything makes me feel iffy. I brushed off whatever concerns I had at first until I got a notification on LinkedIn that someone checked my profile and his name popped up. Again, innocuous as a separate thing but considering the whole context I felt creeped out. He basically is googling me.

I still have doubts and don't know if I'm overreacting. I don't know if I should do anything about it. I mean he didn't do anything technically wrong, it's just uncomfortable. I don't even know what to do if I wanted to address this. Like, should I talk to him privately? Should I talk to the professor? What if I'm overthinking and making a big deal out of nothing and he gets in trouble because of me?

relationship_advice,"My BF (28M) and I (21M) have been dating for a little over 2 months now. I am very into social media, and he knew this going in. We even met on instagram of all places. We would go out consistently and dress up nice and me being me, would want to take selfies with him and post just one because I am proud to be with this man.

He on the other hand, is very against posting pictures of us on his end. Wether it be regular posting or reposting, but specifically reposting. He posted a selfie of us that I took once, after practically begging him for days to do so, but did not include any symbol of acknowledgement that we were together (I.e. a heart emoji, etc) so to everyone else, it just looked like we were hanging as friends. 

I know this doesn’t sound like a big deal to most, but for me, social media is a big deal, as I view it as wanting to show off my partner because I am proud to be with them and think they are adorable. But today, he told me he would rather “delete instagram and social media as a whole than repost pictures of us” even if it is for only 24 hours. 

I told him that him saying that makes me feel like he doesn’t want certain people to see, that he is hiding something, or thinks I’m ugly/embarrassed to show me off to his friends and mutuals. When I expressed this to him, he just kept saying that “that’s not what I use social media for” and “we both use it for different reasons”. Mind you, he has a normal profile just like any other person. 

This really hurt me that he would rather delete social media entirely than repost a selfie on his story of us going out to dinner or something. I can’t help but feel really insecure about this and question how he really feels/sees me. I have never had this issue before in other relationships and I can’t help but feel ashamed of how I look or question what I can do to change his mind.

I guess what I’m writing this for is to just vent or ask if anyone else has gone through this/can offer some advice? :(",0,BF (28M) tells me (21F) that he would rather “delete social media entirely” than repost pictures of us on his story,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8866393,1682485196,0,1682485212,1682485213,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,21,389

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I met in 2nd year of college. We were really close friends  friends for 2ish years before we started dating and now are nearing our 5th year anniversary. 

My bf has pictures on Facebook of his ex girlfriend from high school, who he dated for 9 months during senior year and mutually broke up with shortly into starting college, and that’s how I know about her. He’s also told me the story about how they broke up and etc. 

Honestly, my bf hasn’t given me any reasons to be insecure or to suspect that he still has any feelings for her or anything. Just ever since I saw pictures of her on Facebook and creeped on her Instagram for a little bit like 4 years ago, I’ve objectively felt like she seems so much more attractive than I am!! Like…to the point where I feel embarrassed because I feel like if anyone (even my closest friends/biggest advocates) knew what his ex looked like and then saw me, they’d objectively and inherently know that he downgraded. I know it’s wrong to think this way, but it also doesn’t help knowing that she went to a better school than me..she’s so beautiful and smart 😭

Anyways, I told myself that standards of beauty are different, they broke up for a reason, etc. and then forgot about it. And then like years passed. 

Then a few days ago, my bf tells me that his ex reached out and wanted to meet up to catch up for the first time since they broke up. He asks me for permission, and I told him to go for it. However the past insecurities got to me, and I told my bf that if they were meant to be, no amount of my trying to stop their meeting would work. He was understandably perturbed by this. And then today I ended up crying about feeling insecure and telling him how I felt and I feel irrational. 

This makes me feel like I’m back to square one of trying to get over this. I feel so insecure AND immature.  How do I get over this…objective judgment that she is societally more desirable feeling?

relationship_advice,"Hey, I 19m broke up with my ex gf 18f of 2 years, over the fact she was abusive, not helpful and overall just not the woman for me. The relationship itself went how every other relationship goes, the first 6 months were great! the most kind, caring, loving person you could ever ask for. for me, i will admit, i am a lot more chilled out than most people in this generation, so checking phones, stopping her going out etc was never ever going to cross my mind, but unfortunately for me, she saw things differently, so checked my phone every second she could, and i am not even exxagerating. in the end, it was as if one day i had woken up and thought about things, i realised it had been months since i saw any of my freinds or family (not including father since i live with him), and everytime i tried to, or suggested contacting them, she would become the centre of attention. Without revealing too much, this was an excuse for her to SH in front of me, make me feel bad for speaking to them, the usual. this kind of behaviour occured everytime i tried to do something that did not involve her, even such as just watching a youtube video, or scrolling down my facebook. Anyways, what tipped me over the edge for me, was the feeling of constant battling and arguing so on feb28th i called time on our relationship. a few days later we met up. I thought it was to give her clarity, she thought it was to get back together. it didnt end well. after lots of shouting, crying, SH, and every emotion imaginable, it became clear she was not going to leave my car until i got back with her. I called the police, they escorted her away and that was cleared. Fast forward around a week, i spent her 18th birthday with her. Very stupid, i know, but i did it because i felt bad for her since every freind she once had, was no longer in contact since they also realised what kind of person she was. after a nice night, i drove her home, where another argument occured, and she threw a chair at me. this was the last straw. i stormed out, and when i got home i blocked her and all of her freinds and family on social medias, and i thought that would be it. i was wrong. a few days later, she broke into my house. this really was a last resort for her. i told her she was crazy and drove her home, and have since reported her to the police, for all that, aswell as, later that night, after realising she was never getting back with me, she leaked 3 sex tapes of mine and hers to a random boy, who sent me screenshots of her asking him to fuck her, aswell as the videos.

it has been about 2 months since then. I found out about a week ago she has a new boyfreind. My question is, how could someone do all that to me, and replace me that quickly and easily? 
Also, how do i recover from this? I have some good days and some bad, but it still crushes me thinking about what ive been thru, and also how she has managed to seemingly get over me. 

help is much appreciated.

relationship_advice,"

This guy I met, went out 4 times and each date lasted at least 10 hours. I could tell he was a very “quality time” kind of guy, and he would not touch his phone at all the whole time he is with me. When we are out we usually like to just sit somewhere and talk, and talk.

Once we were drinking and I was tired so had a rest at his place - (and no, we have not slept together) He was supposed to clear up his work that night but because of me he pushed that off and when I felt bad about it, he told me about how he didn’t want to work that day anymore anyway, he said “I can only focus on one thing at a time and for today I’m not going to think about work and am only focusing on you”).

Understandably , this also means that when we are not together, I wouldn’t hear from him much.
I noticed from the beginning about his lack of texting  - he wouldn’t reply  if it doesn’t warrant a reply, if I send him a meme, for example. which is okay! Since I get to talk to him in real life anyway).

Here’s the issue:

He was leaving on a work trip for 2 weeks and right on the day he returns, I would be going out of town for a planned vacation. This would mean we probably wouldn’t see each other for at least 3 weeks.

So far it’s been good and I really like him and despite me usually being cynical with people (have had bad experiences in the past) I thought I wanted to try just…. Having faith? You know? Like, not holding back, express my feelings, be vulnerable.

Before he left I ordered a book delivered to his house as he mention he was thinking of reading this on his trip. Knowing he skips meals a lot, I also passed him a small box of granol and nuts when we last saw each other.

I also if he will send me photos when he is there he said yes, and asked me back the same - if I would send him photos of my vacation.

I took all these to mean that it’s clear I like him and want to see him, and damn I was so proud of myself. 

After he arrives, he sent me some photos of buildings and food on day 1. I happened to be online so we talked for a bit. He was the same (not much of a texter) and when the convo is obviously fizzling  he stopped replying.

Which would be ok! Except he didn’t reach out at all again. On day 5 I sent him a quick photo of a nice view and said “sending my regards from up here!” He did not reply. (Does that not warrant a reply?)

It is day 8 now and now it’s really starting to get to me. I understand he doesn’t enjoy texting but —  Wouldn’t that mean we won’t talk at all for the next 3 weeks? Or am I simply just ghosted?

How do I continue “having faith”? I have been working on myself the past years and been through tons of therapy and I’m really trying not to let my avoidance and fear of abandonment set in but damn.

relationship_advice,"So basically when we just met and started going on dates she would randomly tell me about “that one time” she fucked a friend at a party and at the time it was all playful and I didnt see it as a problem. She would laugh so ofc I would also laugh it off and thought not much of it (She has mostly male friends btw).
For me she is my first and from what she told me (along with the names) its like 3 or 4 guys. Mind you I did not ask for the names or anything, she just told me randomly when talking me about them.
Now that we are together for a couple months it’s starting to slowly hurt and anytime she mentions one of those names I get kinda sick to the stomach because I remember her “funny stories”. 
I told her how it makes me feel and she got mad and told me to forget about the past. She stopped mentioning that stuff completely but trust me I try to forget and somehow even a simple name she drops can trigger my overthinking mind…

He doesn’t go to my school but when we met because a mutual friend brought him to a meeting I was at, there was immediate chemistry. I thought he was cute but didn’t dwell on it till the next time we met at an event together again, where he sat directly next to me, we were joking around the whole time like we were in our own world and my crush just grew from there. That night I looked him up, as we all do with the people we like, on social media only to find out that he was in a relationship. Tonight his friend brought him again and he sat next to me again, even though there were other open chairs, but this time it was so close his leg was touching mine. He kept bumping his chair against mine and hitting my leg with his along with nudging me with his arm. Every time a joke is made either by him or someone else, he looks at me. He was talking to me the whole time even with his friend sitting near him who he barely interacted with. When we were leaving and I was talking to some other people he was waiting behind for me even though his friend was already out the door waiting for him. I don’t know if I’m going crazy and I’m not trying to pull anything because I respect the boundary that he is in a relationship. But I find it odd with his behavior and that he hasn’t mentioned that he has a girlfriend, the only reason I know is because I snooped. I know if I was dating someone and they were acting like this towards another girl I would be uncomfortable, I honestly just don’t know what to do or if I’m just overthinking things because I have a crush.

relationship_advice,"My gf and I are currently LDR for college. Our relationship hasn't been the strongest due to the separation strain, and we had a bit of a rough patch last summer before we went LDR, but we've been making it work. One of the issues in the relationship is I don't feel she really desires me in the way I desire her. I'm not sure how to approach talking to her about this without her feeling like I'm accusing her of something. However during our time apart I've become friends with this girl who I have developed a crush on. I've tried to deny the feeling, and I don't believe it's even reciprocated and it's made me feel like complete shit for feeling this way. For anyone else who's developed crushes in relationships what did that mean for you? Does this mean that I'm not as in love with my gf as I tell myself I am? Is it just the separation or is it something more? I don't know how to feel, and I don't really have anybody to confide in right now.

relationship_advice,"How do I make my wife fall in love again?

I don't even know how I got her to see me, more less love me, in the first place, and that was 15 years ago. It hasn't all been bad. Not in the least. It's just been these last 3 1/2 years really, but most definitely the last year and a half. 

Over time we've become different people, mentally and emotionally, than we were way back when. But I myself have become a different pperson physically aswell, and that has played a huge part in our arguments that do turn into 'fights'. Because no longer am I just some 540lbs  morbidly obese teddy bear that tends to be loud sometimes, now I'm your average 6'0"" 224lbs dude that tends to be physically intimidating/domineering, without even realizing it. So now, unbeknownst to me, I have introduced a 'fear' factor into the arguements. 

It also doesn't help that I'm like the President Trump of husbands; ya know, every time I get the chance to say the right thing I go and say the wrong thing. Never fails.

I have nobody to turn to. Nobody to lean on. Nobody to confide in. I'm just your average guy: I go to work, I pay my bills, I take care of my family and I understand that I don't matter.

The problem is that I think it's too late. I've agreed to and attended the couples counseling, but I think it was too late. I've agreed to and attended the parenting classes, but I think it was too late. I've agreed to anger management courses and having been scorching the earth trying to find some in my budget and travel range. I found some yesterday that my state will accept that are well within my budget and 100% online, but I think it was too late. I see **(for months)** now that all the years of her just doing what she thought I wanted wasn't just her being absent from our relationship, it was her way of putting *me first*, but I think I seen it too late.

It's hard for me to reconcile that she says/thinks/feels/believes or whatever you want to call it, that I am abusive. I don't feel like I am. I feel like I am passionate, sometimes too passionate in what I believe or think is ""right/fair"". But I do concede that it has been close, physically, on two occasions, and regret those moments more than anything.

I can also concede that I have narcissistic tendencies, and I have to catch myself sometimes from being emotionally manipulative. It is a survival skill that I picked up at an early age and I have held onto it for way, way too long. 

How do I convince her that I am not a piece of shit, that I'm not filled with unchecked rage and aggression, that I'm not a stranger? 

How do i convince her that I see now and that my eyes are clear?

How do I make her see the truth; that I am still the boy she feel in love with and the man she decided to marry and that I was just lost in the universe and drifted off course without knowing it, but am now charting a course back to ***US*** ?

relationship_advice,"*Potental triggers** I (27f) and my boyfriend (30m) are currently in a rough place I don't know how to navigate. Before I get into things I do want to add some extra context. First we have been together three years. Towards the end of last year we both mental health wise were not in a good place and we decided to take a break to focus on ourselves; and decide if this is what we both want. About two months later we reconnected and got back together. Secondly, him and I are both SA survivors.

Now where I need help. A couple weeks after him and I got back together he got a knock on the door from the police saying he is being accused of SA from someone he hooked up with while we weren't together. I did know he slept with someone else. He was very honest about it before we got back together.  He explained this person wanted more but he didnt. She got upset because he was under the impression it was a one night stand. After this he has gone into a complete downward spiral. He got physically sick thinking anyone would say he did something like this.
Even debating self harm. 

My partner is the type of person due to his trauma refuses to start any interactions without consent. I'm talking every time we were ever intimate he asked if it was okay first. So for me I had internal conflict.  I struggled believing the accusations but struggled because I never want to not believe a fellow survivor. That was until about  two weeks later when she messaged him saying she knows he didn't do anything to her but her BF found out and was angry. For him this triggered a schizophrenic episode. 

His spiral has gotten to the point he is even pushing me away. I see him maybe once every 2 -3 weeks. He hardly responds to messages. If we make plans he cancels last minute or never responds. He used to tell me how much he loved me but I haven't heard him say it since this started. Ive never had an episode with him last this long. Usually its a few days, maybe a week, and then we start getting back to baseline. I'm pretty sure he is or is very very close to a full mental breakdown attempting to deal with all of this. I want to support him but I honestly don't know how. I try messaging him once a day at least good morning or reminding him I love him and am here for him. Most go unanswered. But I also don't know if I should stop or keep going and trying. Its starting to trigger my abandonment issues. Which is selfish because clearly he has a lot going on.

relationship_advice,"I met one of my best friends in 2011. We have been friends for over 10 years, even after I move 6 hours north to College. However, especially in the last few years I’ve become frustrated due to the one sidedness of our friendship. 

So last year when she finally graduated college, I flew home for the weekend to be at her birthday and graduation celebration. I now live 2 states over, had my flights canceled and had to pay more for rebooked flight to make sure I got there. I was there. I was so happy for her. Now that was June 2022, and that was the very last conversation I had with her. 

She forgot my birthday for the 3rd year in a row and I didn’t reach out for the first time when I came home over Christmas. I did chose to not text her or reach out. I am not surprised that without my effort, I haven’t heard from her. It hurts so much. About 3 months ago I drunk texted her asking why we weren’t friends and got no response back. 

Now last month my boyfriend (now fiancé) of 5 years proposed and she was still one of the first people I wanted to tell. I need to move on but I don’t know how to stop being miserable about our friendship ending.

relationship_advice,"I (29M) Recently started seeing a girl (28F) that I live with. We’d spent most evenings together, been on a date, were starting to have sex and things were going well.

2 weeks in, we threw a house party. At the party, she caught me talking to a girl (pure chat nothing bad) and later that evening expressed that she’d be upset if I got with anyone.

Later that evening I went to town with a group from the party and she didn’t want to go. I returned from town later to find her cuddled up on the couch with another guy. She didn’t say anything as I walked past, nor did I. (I’m very different to this guy btw, polar opposite “types”)

I shortly after went to get a glass of water from the kitchen and she was walking this guy past me down to her room. I messaged her saying “the disrespect” and she replied “nothings gonna happen, don’t like him that way”.

Next morning she comes to see apologising and saying nothing happened. I was upset but chose to believe her.

Since then (2 months have passed), I’ve had a guard up and a bad gut feeling something happened. I (not proudly) snooped her fb, searched the guys name and found a message 2 days after the party from her to her friend saying “I got with X at a party last night, he’s super cute, look at him on Y’s story)

It’s since come out they did stuff (no vivid detail but sex occurred), but she’s saying she wasn’t into it and eventually stopped it as it made her uncomfortable given the situation. Says she messaged the friend that because the friend would be proud she’s finally moved on from her ex..

She’s since developed big feelings for me and regrets what happened. It’s made me so insecure. I don’t know what to do. I feel shit

She was saying it was early days, but then she set the tone earlier about not getting with others

After consideration and talking to family I have decided to leave.
Unfortunately I had to leave behind a few things which I cannot collect till his parents come back (due to the fact his parents own the building we are renting at) he (my 35M BF) is afraid that my brother might come over and steal some things or destroy his place. Honestly I don’t even know why he would think that.
Because I left in such a rush and due to how he didn’t try to talk to me calmly but rather yelled at me he happened to reach out to me upset but I managed to agree that tomorrow we will be meeting up to talk like civil people.
With this in mind I managed to think about what I want and how I will tell him how I no longer wish to be in a relationship but instead remain friends since we were better off as friends from the beginning, and since we both have a pet together I would like to continue to co-parent our dog.

relationship_advice,"TDLR: My ex has been spending more and more time with me everyday and says he loves me so much and treats me like a boyfriend.

He broke up with me two months ago and a month ago we started hooking up again. We both missed each other deeply. I still didnt heal from this break up.

Anyways, we started slow but weeks after we became acting like a couple again. We held hands in public, etc. Hes been calling me ""my boy"" ""my babe"" and last night I had to have the conversation with him about what is happening. He doesn't want to give me a second chance. So at this point I have no clue what the hell we are, because we have been acting like a couple again, especially in public.

I don't understand this. He claims he's still in love with me and enjoys my company but somehow still doesnt want to date me. And here I am heartbroken again. How can someone TELL you they truly never got over you and still have so much love but simply don't want to go back. To me love is something so beautiful, if theres still love theres nothing we can't fix it. Man, this is such a hard situation and we started hooking up again I knew I was in for trouble but couldn't stop because it feels good. I feel so undersaving of love. I fell like a horrible person but I put myself in this situation

Now here I am. Suffering. Every since the breakup I havent seen anyone else besides my ex and I can't think of anyone else either. We are together right now and like mentioned, we have been sleeping together daily pretty much and spending time together. I found him on gay hook up apps and he says hes sorry and he loves me but hes single. Somehow that still hurts me so much... just the idea that we are ""together"" but not really and he is looking for hook ups (and I'm not). I know this is my fault. I allowed him back into my life but somehow I can't see myself without him so having him like this is better than not having him at all.

I had stopped drinking at about 8pm, and we got an Uber around 9:45pm. My boyfriend wanted to go home and I was indecisive but ultimately ended up meeting 1 friend at a bar. We were in line waiting for about 30 minutes, by the time we got in it was 10:30pm and I felt completely sober. Well, I ordered one drink, then one more shortly after that, and I blacked out until the next day at around noon. When I woke up, my room had told me everything that happened. My  friend, who i was at the bar with, and I invited 2 guys over to the house and I had slept with one of them, and my roommate found me outside with no pants on. I had absolutely no memory of what happened. My boyfriend was furious, and I had no answers for him. Turned out I gave the guy who I hooked up with my number and he had texted me asking about his wallet, so my boyfriend made me call him and ask him what happened, and the guy said that I was the one coming on to him, and that it was a consensual situation. My boyfriend was pissed and took all his things and went to his dads house. That same day I went to an urgent care and took a drug test. About a week or so passed of my boyfriend staying at his dads, texting me rude things, and then I finally got my drug test results. Results showed i tested positive for Benzodiazepines, after a Google search i then understood and came to an assumption that i might had possibly been drugged with Xanax. I only think Xanax because I had taken it twice in the past and both times I experienced black out, just never experienced it while drinking. My boyfriend is still skeptical about it all and his emotions have been a roller coaster, but I believe his feelings are completely valid. I keep assuring him that I would never do anything like that in my right mind, and that I don’t want to break up. I love him so much and I don’t want to lose him and I feel so ashamed of what happened and it disgusts me that something like that even happened. My boyfriend is hurt that I did anything and is questioning whether or not he wants to stay with me. I hate that I made him feel this way and I wish I could take it all back and the fact that I don’t remember makes it even more complicated. I suggested therapy together but he seems to be against that. I have been sober ever since, i don’t ever want to put myself in a situation like that ever again and been sober was my first step. I started going t church, as turning to God has been comforting throughout this.I feel so impure and dirty and just flat out horrible. I just don’t know how to control my emotions and what to think and what to say to him. I love him so much it hurts and i honestly don’t know what I’ll do if he decides to leave me. Any advice is helpful, I know I fucked up but I’m really trying to make things better. I want to marry this man and I truly love him with all my heart, saving our relationship means the entire world to me.",0,I (24F) cheated on my boyfriend (27M).,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8865875,1682479432,0,1682479445,1682479445,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,7,660
relationship_advice,"I was friends with this dude who I'll call L for about 4 or 5 years. 3 years into our friendship we decided to have a short fling, it lasted like maybe a few months. Anyways we both got into relationships. At the time he got a girlfriend he did tell me and he was really open with me. My boyfriend and I broke up and his girlfriend and him broke up a month or so after. We started a casual fling again, I went away for school and he visited me a few times. We ended up talking and decided to become exclusive, it was that way for about 4 months until he ghosted me and unadded me from all social media. 

A few days ago he reached out saying he wanted to talk, I said I would be ok with talking in person and he said he'd see if he could visit me someday soon and let me know. I don't really know what to do. I love him and I want to be with him again but he hurt me so bad last time I'm nervous it could happen again. I'm going to talk with my therapist about this tomorrow to see a healthy way to navigate it but I was wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and how it played out? I plan on putting little effort until he proves he cares I guess, just taking initiative and acknowledging what he did. I don't know, some of my friends say to give him a chance, some tell me I was just a backup for someone else that didn't workout and he's gonna do the same thing. Is this a bad idea? I really dont want to be the girl who lets the guy do whatever and always goes back, but also I believe in second chances and he's usually very genuine and caring.

relationship_advice,"I have a friend who I once would consider one of my college bestie. But currently trying to decide how much effort if any I want to put into continue this friendship. In the past there have always been small things that have bothered me in our relationship. 
1. She always texted me to hang out when her boyfriend was busy and her other bff wasn’t available.
2. When venting about life problems she would always give me advice on things I didn’t even ask about and come off almost like she knew it all which didn’t bother me as much but what does is she gets upset if I offer her advice or insight into things as well.
3. And this one I understand but it still discourages me at times, if she is in a depressed stage of life she never responds to me and cuts me off.

Now onto the overall concern. Currently it feels as if we are in completely different stages in life. She got engaged to her bf last august and she invited me to the wedding, and to get ready with her and her 4 bridesmaids (her 2 sisters, Childhood friend and other college bff) apparently she wanted me as a bridesmaid but there wasn’t enough groomsmen. Around the exact same time my grandmother who I was extremely close to died, and she was there for me that whole week, but after that week all she could talk about was her wedding, I did the best I could to not get annoyed at this and thought things would get better after she got married, but it hasn’t. Now Majority of what she talks about is trying to convince her husband to have kids. And minor things start to annoy me like the fact that she says how she doesn’t want to be “old” (she means 25) with no kids because that’s pathetic (I’m 24 and single) And also constantly telling me how hard it is to find a nice guy and says things like “I know it’s exhausting meeting a nice guy I get it, same” and this just annoys me because she hasn’t been single for the last 5 years. On one hand I think she’s trying to relate to me but I’m not sure if I should tell her how much this actually bothers me and try to work this new dynamic out and on another hand I have another bff who got married a few months before she did and her and I haven’t had this problem at all and part of me feels like a good friend would take an interest in my life outside of just relationship (example like my job or hobby’s) She doesn’t text unless she’s bored and when we call it feels so disconnected thoughts on if I should continue this relationship?",0,I (24F) am finding it hard to connect with my now married friend (23F),r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8865850,1682479125,0,1682479142,1682479143,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,14,477
relationship_advice,"
About a year ago my (25f) ex (30m) abruptly left me and it shattered me. We had a good relationship with really great chemistry but the relationship wasn’t perfect. Some would call it a twin flame relationship. We were living together and on a random day after telling me i had treated him the best he’s ever been treated, he decided he didn’t want to be with me. Not because he didn’t love me but because he felt we had different ideas of trust and transparency. These were his words, and they were fair because I had triggers from a prior traumatizing relationship with a narcissist that i had to work through and there were a few things that I found my ex my do that I felt were disrespectful to me (dancing w other girl at club, adding a bunch of random girls on socials etc). At that point in my life I needed a partner that would be patient with me as i was working through traumas and also be 100% respectful to our relationship and he wasn’t that. 

Anyway, fast forward to now. I’m healed from this heartbreak and have moved past it. I moved out of state temporarily as well. A part of me deep down felt like this is the man i would end up with after we’ve both healed from our pasts but I’m leaving that up to whatever higher power, it’s not something i focus my energy on. My best friend from my childhood has been dating my exes brother and I found out that he will be asking her to marry him and I couldn’t be happier for them. I am obviously close with both of them and see them often. I was back in town and ran into my ex a couple weekends ago and he asked me if I wanted to grab a drink with him and I did. We had been no contact since October. Ended up back at his place, we messed around and i slept over but I didn’t “sleep with him” as that was the boundary I set. We caught up and talked for hours, talked about some things regarding our relationship, he told me things like he had been thinking about me, asked me what my friends would think if I got back with an ex, cuddled me all night and when I went to leave I hugged him and walked away and he asked me for a kiss which I thought was odd… so I agreed and kissed him.  He texted me for a couple days after that and I entertained it, then I flew back to my new temporary home and we haven’t spoken much. Ill be back in my hometown soon and I’m wondering how anyone else might navigate a relationship with an ex of this sort. I don’t want things to be messy, I enjoy having some kind of relationship with him but I do realize it might get weird one day if either of us get into another relationship.",0,Navigating a relationship with my (25F) ex (30M) who will be relevant in my life forever,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8865850,1682479104,0,1682479119,1682479119,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,16,509

relationship_advice,"Backstory: I met my bf 2ish years ago, things were great and there was undeniable chemistry. About half a year into dating, I moved out of my toxic household into my new place. It was nice finally being allowed to go out/ make my own choices. But as a consequence my parents relationship with me has soured. My bf was there to help support me along the way as best he could, and his family has been very welcoming towards me. 

I’m now about 2.5 years into the relationship and for the last year it feels like I’ve just grown more contempt towards my bf.  I’ve brought up to him several times how it makes me upset that I have to ask him to be more organized, responsible, plan ahead, etc. I tell him about how I had to figure taking care of myself on my own, and it’s annoying that he lives at home, has a maid come by, and he is still messy/ unorganized.

I’ve cooked and told him that it’s nice if he offered to do dishes or take out trash or try cooking for me. He tried to cook and tbh it was a half ass attempt (he scrambled to get groceries and threw everything in a pot- I suggested reason the recipe and he told me that everyone cooks differently and he’s improvising. He has improved on helping out with chores. 

When I cook and give him leftovers, pretty much every time he takes it home and leaves it in the fridge and ends up tossing it because he never got around to eating it. I told him how it hurts my feelings because I spend a lot of time and money (I get a teacher salary btw) buying groceries and preparing food for us and when he willing takes home and tosses it, it’s insulting. 

Tbh the list goes on but there’s a gut feeling that I’ve been getting lately that honestly makes me feel like he doesn’t uplift my life. I feel like I’ve gotten less motivated and he enables me by not saying anything to motivate me. 

He is a genuine good intentioned person, and I feel so bad to say that it feels like he just doesn’t get it. He doesn’t get how to properly take care of himself without help, and makes rash decisions without thinking about the outcome. And I’m tired of being the one to tell him. I’ve spoken to my therapist and suggested he speak to one too since I’ve gotten too overwhelmed with pretty much playing therapist for him. I don’t know if the relationship is salvageable and this is just a phase, or if I should get out of the relationship.

relationship_advice,"As is says in the title my boyfriend and I just got in a fight over him not sharing a text conversation with me. 
A little background. My boyfriend has more friends than I do and has way more female friends than male friends. One of his best female friends is an old ex of his. We’re talking 15 years in the past. In the past he has shared with me that he was talking to this friend about how much I hate his last girlfriend. This made me feel like he was gossiping about me and it was a fight back then.
Also in the past we had some tension because I would feel like stuff would be going on in his life and with his family that he simply just wouldn’t share with me unless I pried. That was our first fight and it was not great. 
Any time I am talking to my sister or anyone I always share with him what’s going on with my family, we work together but both away from our homes. 
Today he was getting texts and smiling and laughing. When I asked who he was texting he said his same friend. I asked what was up and he said she said our picture was cute. He went to the bathroom for a long while and when he came out I asked him what picture. He was like oh you know which one. And I said no I don’t, this went back and forth for a while and then he finally threw me his phone. And they had a whole conversation about her making a sticker of our picture and referencing Star Trek, which I love, and it was perfectly normal and fun. It wasn’t a surprise thing just a conversation. This upset me though and I told him I felt like he was living a double life because he never shares stuff like this. The only way I know what’s going on in his life outside of our relationship a lot of the times is because I feel like I have to pry. 
He basically started calling me an asshole and told me I was crazy and have trust issues. I asked him to please not call me an asshole. Then I said so this is 100% my fault I am crazy and you’ve done nothing? He said yes. 
I know I have trust issues. That comes from my past relationships and trauma, however I don’t think that I am being crazy. No he is not cheating on me, but I feel like he is emotionally unavailable or just keeping things from me. I’m a relationship I hold a lot of value in sharing things and communicating.
I don’t know.

relationship_advice,"My friend (24M) and I (24F) have been close friends for about 6 years now. I’ll call him K for the sake of this being easier to read through.

Over the course of the past year, and probably for even a bit longer than that, I feel like we have been growing apart emotionally. The reasoning for this is because I feel as though K both acts disrespectful towards me, and places me on a pedestal. Its important to mention that K only has a couple online friends who he games with but other than that he rarely hangs out with anyone socially but me. I feel like it’s also important to mention that K is autistic, and sometimes can lack or miss social cues. 
The first time we started to have a problem was when I came out to K about starting to use they/them pronouns instead of she/her. His reaction was to tell me he would continue to use she/her because it is easier for him, and told me that it was okay “as long as i didn’t turn into a crazy person who throws drinks at people for getting their pronouns wrong” (I would NEVER do this and was truthfully having a hard time even telling people i was close with that I wanted to start using those pronouns) it really bothered me that his reaction was so negative and I told him i needed space. Next thing I knew, K was over at a mutual friend S (24f)’s house. They don’t hangout but S is my best friend and K has a very casual friendship with S, im talking like sends her a meme every couple of months. He went over there because he felt as if he had no other options and was worried he was going to hurt or k word himself. This caused my friend S to reach out to me to get me to come talk to him and amend the situation even though I was still hurt and not ready. It also caused issues between me and S on top of that. 
The next instance was when I invited K on a cruise that my family was planning to take. Throughout the trip, there were many times that K told me he didn’t want to have fun without me because it was “my cruise”. He refused to do things without me and spent every second with me even though I made sure to iterate multiple times before we left that I was going to need space at some points to do things alone (this was an 8 day cruise). I had a whole family of 16 on board, so it wasn’t like it was just me and him, and we even made some friends on board i knew he could have hung out with if he wanted too. He still continued to cling to me and even got upset with me when he saw that I attended an event without him, after telling him i was going to take some space for the night. There were many other instances besides this on the cruise as well. 
The final straw was after the cruise, when I said I was going to need some space. K’s house was being built at the time, and something went wrong on move-in day so him and his parents couldn’t stay there that night. Instead of texting me asking to come over, K texted my mom asking if it was okay for him to come spend the night. My mom came into my room confused as to whether he meant to text me, although that wasn’t the case. I reached out and let him know that I thought it was odd for him to go around me knowing I needed space from him to ask my mom if he could come over. His response to that was “this isn’t about you, it’s not your house and all i need is the downstairs bed for the night.” i found that to be a defensive and disrespectful response considering things were already tense from the cruise, and that he was trying to go around me since he knew my mom would say yes. He definitely could have just stayed in the hotel with his parents instead of encroaching on the space he knew i was taking. 
Anyways, I didn’t respond to him for weeks and he never reached out. I decided that i’m not sure I want to continue the friendship, so i at least owe him a conversation. We had a very non-confrontational talk about how things were going, i made sure to mention everything that happened and he apologized saying that i’ve saved his life and that he has abandonment issues. I don’t want to upset or trigger him and I feel awful, but I have to do what’s best for me and take space so I don’t hold any more resentment. 
I feel terrible about all this, especially knowing that he lacks social cues due to autism and some of this stuff is surely due to that. However, I feel so much pressure to be close friends since he has nobody else. I feel like he has very low self esteem and will most assuredly become depressed due to this, but I am exhausted and tired of everything, from sexualizing comments to blatant disrespect even if it isn’t intentional. Every time we fight, he tells me he’s sorry and he will do better and i’ve saved his life and he wouldn’t know what to do without me, yet nothing seems to change. I’m worried he’s going to hurt himself because he has attached himself so much to me. Am I being too harsh in this situation or is it a reasonable response? I feel like I need to do what’s best for me and continue to take space.

relationship_advice,"
(A bit of back story) My boyfriend and I have had been together almost 3 years, and have had a pretty rough relationship. We broke up about a year ago and he essentially convinced me to stay, and while we’re technically in a better place, now without the constant fighting, and only mostly little spats, I’ve noticed we are just a terrible match. I know things don’t have to be perfect to be in a relationship, but we don’t find each others types of humour funny, we don’t have interesting conversations, we’ve been steadily growing sexually incompatible. I’m not saying I’m the worlds most interesting conversationalist, and I feel bad for saying this, but I just find his comments and the very few thoughts he says out loud…terribly mundane. The highs are just not that high, and the lows are very low. When he says “things have been going great with us.” I’m finding I have to bite my tongue. Because while they’re better, I’m bored. Not bored in the I want drama and want to fight way, in the, the dust has settled and now there’s just stagnant dust way. 

(The actual issue) 
Regardless of my analogy of our relationship, I’ve been wanting to break up again, truly, for a little while now. It’s growing more and more and I find myself getting more and more irritated that I haven’t done it yet, and the unfortunate part is now it’s coming out in bad ways. A while ago I had booked us a small quiet getaway for his birthday, and also because he was going away for a while, so we could have some quality time together, so I guess it was around the time that the week away together was coming up that it really clicked that I don’t want to be in this anymore. But it was his birthday. I really couldn’t do it then. 

He’s been away for a while, felt bad to do it then, also thought maybe some time apart would reignite things. Then while he’s been away something terribly traumatic happened to him, I sure as hell am not going to pile on, and I pushed my feelings aside and just tried to focus on being there for him. However I was late getting home to be on the phone with him, and then he didn’t want to talk about it anymore, just the fact that I was late. And that turned into multiple days of the me being late means I’m not there for him talk, turned argument, me apologising, and a lot of -please I’m here for you now let’s talk about what happened- to me being accused of things and lot of old shit being brought up, till one night I got drunk and yelled at him over the phone that he cares more about my 30 minute tardiness than the actual thing that happened. I apparently said that I don’t care and I don’t want to talk to him again. We had kind of a strained conversation the next day, and then a few days later he’s saying he no longer wants to hear me say sorry, to come up with an actual apology. 
Guys it’s not like I don’t know why this is happening. I’m resenting him for convincing me to stay a year ago, I’m resenting myself for staying, I’m not dealing with my emotions towards this well and it’s coming out like that. And even though I know all this, I can’t bring myself to break up with the person I’ve been with for almost 3 years over the phone after he’s had a traumatic experience and then I was a straight up dick. 

He’s even said that if we were to break up then he would just stay where he is longer. That was my window I guess, but still, knowing what just happened to him I can’t make myself pile on. I’m lost here.

relationship_advice,"Just smoked a bowl to write this all out, I'd recommend you grab one yourself or a beverage of your choice, this is a long one.

I haven't been able to see a therapist in almost a year, so I feel like I'm going crazy ruminating over what's happened over the last 3 years on my life. I feel like the healthiest option here would be to break things off, but I genuinely want to be with this man. I've been in some pretty abusive relationships in the past that have left me absolutely fearing abandonment to the point where I avoid confrontation as often as possible. I feel like I need to lay everything on the table and see what someone else thinks of the situation. But I need multiple points of view to make sense of the world (stupid brain) before I can make decisions. I'm not asking for judgement, or who's right and who's wrong because I know damn well we've both done wrong, I just want to know if it sounds like this is worth saving.

&amp;#x200B;

So I (23f) have been married to my husband Kyle (31m) for a year and a half, together for 3 years. We decided 3 months in that we never wanted to spend another day apart, moved in together and got engaged. Thinking back on it, getting married so fast really feels like such an impulsive decision. Right now things are fantastic between us, we get along so well and really know how to speak each other's love languages. The only strain in our relationship is the fact that we work literal opposite shifts during the week, so we only have weekends to spend together. We both disrupt our sleep schedules or work schedules to make time for each other, which I feel like is contributing to my dysregulation. I recently got diagnosed with bipolar2 and autism, and now I'm on medication that also fucks with my sleep, so that's fun. The lack of sleep gets to us and we argue sometimes, but it's not about normal things.   


We both have trust issues with the other, and for one specific reason from each person. During the first few months of our relationship, of course I found porn. He had been a single guy for five years, and I understand that everyone has needs. The issue is, I'm someone who sees using porn while in a relationship as cheating. I didn't have an issue with finding it at first so I just asked him to get rid of it, and told him about how it brings up a lot of traumatic triggers for me (Such as meltdowns and disassociating), so I really just don't like having it in my space or knowing my partner uses it. He was totally okay with it and it wasn't a problem until I got a different job.   


We had worked the same shift at the same job before, so we were attached at the hip during our free time. Took breaks together, lunch together, and did everything together. A few months in I started having severe stomach pain that would leave me in the bathroom for hours at a time. Putting anything in my stomach made me feel like I would throw up and pass out from stomach spasms, and anything coming out the other end was agonizing because the pain got intense when I would flex my abs. It was like this for months, FMLA didn't seem like an option anymore. We couldn't afford for me to quit working so I found a less labor intensive job, but it required me to switch from swing shift to days. Kyle still works swings, and I still work days almost 2 years later.   


About 3 months before the wedding things started getting rocky between us because we weren't seeing each other nearly as often. I found porn on the TV that was recently watched, and it was some pretty fucked up stuff. I found out I'm not his type, and even questioned his sexuality and commitment to me. I've been cheated on in the past, and this left me feeling like I got cheated on. I had been feeling very sensitive and upset during that time so it hurt a little something extra. I confronted him about it and we got in a massive fight. He says he doesn't see watching porn while in a relationship as cheating and couples watch it together all the time. I didn't see this as an excuse to disrespect my boundaries and told him that in my eyes, he cheated on me, all I wanted was an apology and changed behavior. He screamed at me saying ""It's because you're so fucking loose, I can't get off anymore"", stormed out and disappeared for a few hours before coming back, apologizing, and making a scene about how he ""was an asshole"" and ""shouldn't have said such hurtful things just because \[he\] was angry."" He also threw his phone across the room, shattered it, and had to get a new one. I know that he threw his phone instead of hitting me, which scares the shit out of me having been abused before. This was the biggest red flag he's ever given me.  


The problem was, the damage had already be done. My undiagnosed bipolar kicked in and there was a massive switch in my mindset. I went from only wanting this man's attention to ""Don't fucking look at me or I'll hurt your ego."" My husband made it very clear to me that if I ever even thought about cheating on him, to break things off because he becomes ""abusive"". And I ended up thinking about it, literally just because I knew it would be the most painful spot. I thought about it a lot, about one specific person. Let's call him Joey. 

Joey and I were friends from the same workplace I met my husband at, and eventually became my boss for a little while which was awkward as hell. Essentially, Joey and I were friends with benefits on occasion before Kyle and I got together. I lied to Kyle and said I never had any sort of relations with Joey because I didn't want him to feel like he had any sort of competition, which he really didn't at the time. I was so happy in my relationship and I didn't want there to be any kind of strain. Little did I know that lying to protect myself would come back and bite me in the ass, by the tenfold. This comes full circle. That night Kyle called me loose, I snapchatted Joey. I knew he was \*thicker\* than Kyle, and I wanted to see if my husband was lying to me or not. Joey and I talked every so often but it wasn't anything more than memes or something we thought the other person would find funny. So when he replied to my ""how's it going?"" snap with ""Not too bad, how are you doing, gorgeous?"" I took the opportunity to get back at my husband for hurting me so deeply. Hindsight is 20/20, I was not in the right headspace and clinically wasn't myself.  


I wanted revenge. To make him feel the same pain I felt, but everything in me knew that wasn't the right thing to do. A battle started within myself as to what I wanted to do, and I had Joey in my dm's begging me to come stay a night with him. I knew the lay would be fantastic, but I didn't want to ruin the relationship I had with Kyle at the same time. I ended up losing the battle and went to Joey's house, where one thing led to another. But the thing that has me fucked up is that Joey didn't just casually fuck me, he made love to me while I was on complete autopilot. I feel absolutely awful about the fact that I broke the biggest boundary in my relationship, with someone that made that kind of love. Joey was a total fuckboy, so it surprised me getting that kind of intimacy from him which we didn't have before. I also got my answer, I was tight as hell. (Probably because I didn't feel like I was in my body.)  


I think about it every single day, Kyle still doesn't know. He knew something was wrong and has been questioning me ever since. He noticed my slight obsession (I obsess over my close friends) with Joey increase over time, and confronted me about how much I was talking to him. I admitted that I fell out of love with him for a while and was interested in Joey, but said that it didn't go anywhere. He asked me to block him on everything, so I did. But the trust was broken on his end since I had lied about not being with Joey before we got together, and it's still eating me alive because 2 days after we got married, I found out I was pregnant. I didn't know who the father was at first so I was panicking, but based on the dates and how far along I was at the ultrasound, it was my husband's. Kyle didn't think he could have kids and accused me of cheating.. Which wasn't wrong but I didn't want him to know. I ended up having an extremely traumatizing miscarriage. Part of me feels like that was my karma for cheating.. WHILE PREGNANT. I didn't know but even then, what I did was beyond fucked up. I got medicated for my bipolar about 6 months ago, and now I feel like I'm seeing things more clearly. It was such a pain in the ass to get any sort of mental health help because the doctors weren't taking my post-miscarriage depression seriously.   


We almost broke up on our 1 year anniversary, so about 2 months go. We had the conversation of ""this is why we don't trust each other, and do we want to move forward with this?"" Talked about what we would do if we did break up, but I don't feel like I had any closure from it because it was left kinda open like ""well we could still break up."" I know the right thing to do would to be to tell him the truth, allow the separation, and just live my life, but I've never loved someone the way I love Kyle, and vise versa. We truly care about each other, he is the best thing that has ever happened to me. This man has learned so much patience while being together, and is trying to be a better person every day. I don't want to break up with him over the possibility of him becoming abusive while angry, I would leave him if he did become abusive.  


But, yeah. That's really it. I feel like ""Should I stay or should I go?"" is always playing in my head. I love this man to death and I can't imagine building a life with anyone else, but I feel like I need to pay for what I've done, and that price is losing my husband. I really am concerned that he will get physical when I tell him I cheated, which is the only thing that is stopping me from telling the truth. Should I continue to keep this as my shitty dirty little secret?

I’ll try to make this simple but at the same time still provide as much necessary details as possible. I started dating one of my co workers after she quit because she has a rule that she doesn’t date co workers, and she was planning to leave the job anyways so i guess it kind of worked out. On the last week before she left, one of my other co workers, a older guy, I’m 37 btw, he’s probably maybe in his 50s? Well anyways, he was making small chit chat with her about the next job etc and mentioned to her about his second job. He then gave her all the information etc and then wished her good luck. For this story ill assign his name as Greg. 

So the day after she left, we started going out and getting to know each other. Everything was going great and we are still together to this day. About 2-3 months after she quit she then decides to go apply for the job that Greg was telling her about and she gets hired and starts working. Everything was going pretty cool, and maybe a month or two in she moves out from her moms to get her own place. One day I came over to visit her and spend the night, because her work shift is 7pm-330 am 5 days a week. So I spend the night and she comes home in the morning. I wake up and start getting ready for work and when I opened the refrigerator there are roses in it. I asked her where she got them from and she said Greg got it for her as a house warming gift. Ok. 

At that time I didn’t think too much of it, so I proceeded to go to work. I then get to work and during my shift I walk over to Greg and thank him for referring my girlfriend into his work and he said no problem. A few more weeks go by and I spend the night once again. When I wake up and get ready for work, same thing like deja vu, another dozen roses in the refrigerator. I once again ask, lol who’s getting you roses?? And she replies greg got me those. Ok….another week goes by and bam once again. A few more weeks go by and yet again! Another dozen roses. So I then ask her who’s been buying you all these damn roses haha and she replied, Greg. Ok. Well why the hell is he buying you roses? And she replied that Greg bought them for her and he bought some for his wife too. Ok. I’m starting to feel strange. The following week I have tickets to go to a basketball game and she’s off and home that day. I come over and she asks hey do you have tickets to that game? I said yea. Oh ok I think I’ll see you there then. Wait what?? You got tickets too? Greg asked me to go to the game with him. I reply, why? You and Greg and his wife? Nope. Greg said all he wanted for his birthday is to go to the game with me. Now at this time my spidey senses are tingling like crazy! And I ended up, sadly, peeking at her phone when she fell asleep. And I find text message after text message between her and Greg. For about 4 months straight. I scroll all the way to the top and it’s just the general stuff, ya know like work talk because she just started. Then it starts getting real weird. And I am particular with people on what words they use when they speak etc.
Greg starts asking for a dolled up pic of her, calling her beautiful, and it progressed into I love you. I’m reading these texts and she’s not really the one pursuing, nor is she entertaining him so much that it would have kept it all going. So now I’m like, wait a fucking min lol. I’ve been working with Greg for over 10 years, dudes married has kids has his wife’s photos even at his desk at work where everyone can see. Wtf is he doing? Lol. So I then get to asking her, hey is there some kinda funny shit going on between you and Greg and she replies like grossed out, wtf is wrong with you! That guy is old as shit he’s just a old man and needed a lunch break friend to eat with. We go back and forth for a min or two and I then tell her, you aren’t going to that game with him. She replies but I already said I would go. Smh. 

Babe, I need to ask you this. This doesn’t seem strange to you one bit? He has a wife and two kids at home, both over the age of 18 that can accompany him to the game, why the hell would he want to go with just the two of you?!? So fast forward she still works with Greg but they work different areas now as she spends her lunch break in her car now, because she now calls and face times me, both of which I didn’t impose, etc. and I still work with Greg. And to be quite honest, I’m lucid and pissed. I’ve been wanting to confront him because I honestly and genuinely believe he was possibly trying to have a affair with my gf on his wife. 

So my question is one of many, was I in the wrong for telling my gf she can’t talk to him or go to the game  ? Should I confront him? Tell his wife? We’re both in strong professional careers and as mad as I am, I think I may feel bad if our entire workplace found because unfortunately in my work, word spreads quick, and I’m just so pissed with him I can’t afford to lose my job getting physical but I still feel the need to confront him.

relationship_advice,"I have known this guy since kindergarten he was my best friend from the start we clung to each other as much as we could when we were younger. We shared a lot of the same interests played the same games watched the same shows. A normal childhood friendship but things have not always been great between us. I didn't look at anything being wrong with this back then but I do now the problem is he is a bully and very competitive with me at times.

It has always been there wed get competitive about card games or who can draw better or do a certain thing better. Most little boys are like that and we were children so I didn't see anything bad about it I just thought that is how people acted. However, this has continued to be a thing in our adult relationship and it makes me uncomfortable and angry at times but don't know how to react at times. So I just try to fight back and insult him back if he digs at me or ill be competitive back even though I'm just trying to have fun but I can't do it anymore.

we have both charged over the years after 6th grade I moved away for a year out of state so this was the first time I was away from my family and familiar friends and surroundings. A year passes I come back home he's joined the football team and started talking to all these people we used to dislike because we were the nerdy kids. I hadn't changed much after returning I was still the quiet, shy nerdy type. I developed depression after coming back from the move and our differences in changes didn't flow with each other but we stayed friends because why wouldn't we we were there from the start for each other.

High school started the changes were much more noticeable between us we still hung out he came over to my house like he always did we played games and would chill and talk about dumb stuff like friends do. I noticed the competitiveness he has always had for me just got worse hed gets visibly upset if I beat him in anything. I tried to reach out to him about my depression we were 15 and 16 respectively he told me I wasn't depressed so I just never talked about it again after that. A few months later I started self-harming and my mental health became much worse but I just stayed quiet and continued self-harming getting no sleep and just acting like things were normal. He was more of the popular football player he had a nickname and everything I saw myself as the quiet loner his friends insulted me at times and he wouldn't defend me so I just wouldn't be around him during school.

Things haven't changed years later he is still competitive, he isn't supportive but always asks me for advice or favors. He only comes around when I agree to do one of those favors and honestly, I just don't enjoy being around him like I used to. I couldn't open up to him years ago but asks for my advice on his relationship and insulted an ex of mine about her weight. The breaking point for me typing this was when I had a panic attack the other morning woke up to it and was pretty much bedridden the entire day. I texted him about and he said he had a panic attack a few minutes before messaging him and then continued to talk to me about his relationship and a girl he is dating currently.

relationship_advice,"Me and my bf comes from a very conservative South Indian background. I’m a university student staying with my parents settled in gulf while him doing his med final . My parents are super conservative when it comes to marriage and I have very rough past about my dads family when it comes to marriage they are extremely toxic all including my dads sister they wanted my parents to get separated even though they knew my mom since her birth. 
and my mom has been struggling with her toxic in-laws for the past 24 years and my dad also plays along with his family just keep them happy and me growing up watching my father feels very hurt on how he forces my mom and feelings yet she has to stay for the sake of me and my sibling just to hold and love. Even though he really loves us as family when he’s at home but pretends to be less caring again to just to make them happy outside.

Cut to my bf loves his family and he’s extremely protective about it and he wants me to come stay with them in village do no work just take care and make things work as good girls family where I’m completely convinced when I always try to explain about how can I trust him when gets offended about my thinking towards a family . he starts his healthy lecture saying how nice it is &amp; very different then my fam and how I’m overthinking and I don’t know what is life and how I can fit in he becomes super offensive and verbally abuses me at the heat of the argument and then apologizes for him being rude and how I don’t understand.
he’s super caring lovely sweet but I don’t like this habit of his trying to tell me how I can be and it’s nothing to worry he also speaks to my mom about it &amp; she speaks for him on how lovable he is and it’s no harm adjusting because she wants me to be in good hands unlike my dad &amp; advices me how to. 
Since we’re in a long distance relationship for 3 years and will be till I get married wants me to spend more time with him in person alone having our own space after marriage since he has a very conservative cultural background. 
I really appreciate them making my bf raise at their worst and really want them to be for him they can visit us we can visit stay with them on the weekends and good days.
He tells we would move out later and make things work when cry about it but I’m not sure

relationship_advice,"We have been together 7 months and we are so happy together. I have talked to him about p*rn and my opinion on it. I have some childhood trauma with it and very much hate it. About 2 months ago I got very descriptive about my trauma and told him that I hated it. He was very comforting about the whole situation. 


Today, I was on his phone looking for a specific picture and couldn’t find it so I went to his recently deleted. I saw 3 TikTok’s that had been saved ( 1st one: March 31st, 2nd one: April 3rd, 3rd one: April 10th). They were videos where girls were doing the “let’s see how good you pause game is, flash edition). So, out of anger I go and check his search history and 3 tabs of p*rn were there, multiple tabs apart. 


I’ve been sick for a couple weeks and have had some vaginal issues, therefor we’ve only had sex once in almost a month. But, I have been pleasing him every so often. I would like to add that we also have lost our virginity to each other.


I confronted him about it and he says he’s so sorry. He only watched the p*rn because he wanted to learn new things and perform better in bed, he said he hasn’t been self pleasuring to these videos. And, he knows he was in the wrong with the TikTok’s and is very sorry.

relationship_advice,"So for some context, this is my boyfriend's first relationship, and this is my first \*genuine\* relationship. Those who've understand, understand. In the past, we've had issues where he'd accuse me of liking someone or being interested in another person. Every time I prove this is not the case, as I truly love him more than anybody. 

And to anyone who thinks that these suspicions are a result of me having some kind of shady behavior, it's NOT. These moments can be triggered by things such as me talking to another dude (even if it's only in passing), mentioning a guy in a conversation and even standing close to a guy a couple of times. Mind you it's during things such as projects or in a work environment where being close to them is rather a necessity. I don't mean touching shoulders either, I mean arm's length talking to one another whilst doing work.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the situation:

My boyfriend and I were on a call. I was playing a game in the background, as I'd just gotten off work and it's typically something I do to wind down. after 10-20ish minutes I'd gotten off the game and asked my boyfriend was he was doing. We were on a Facetime call, and he'd stopped talking as much, and I wanted to know what he was up to. So I asked and he was quiet for a little until he said ""Okay, I'm done reading now"".

Now ik my boyfriend, he's not much of a reader at all. So ofc I was curious as to what he was reading. So, I asked, and he said, ""You and Sam's (fake name) messages"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to reference that these messages weren't from my phone, but a conversation from that happened on Discord in 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sam and I have been friends for a bit of time, we met around 2019. As I'm laughing, I asked ""What were you reading"" because Sam and I had some pretty humorous conversations, and I was totally down to read old messages and laugh about them (as my boyfriend and I have the same humor). I thought it'd be a thing we could laugh about. He gets extremely serious and starts getting mad at me saying I ""lied to him"". At this point, I'm completely floored. Genuinely floored for a moment I was just like, huh??? In the messages, it was us talking about porn and certain film stars. A conversation that despite the sexual content we were discussing-- wasn't sexually motivated. 

I would like to emphasize the point that Sam and I have NEVER and most importantly WILL NEVER have any kind of sexual relationship. The both of us don't view each other, and I'd find it very weird to even entertain that idea for anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my boyfriend what exactly I had lied about. And he claimed that I had told him I never touched myself with that kind of material. I can confidently say that is a LIE. I have in fact viewed porn. It's 2023, it's not a new thing. Everyone has, it's not some crazy concept. In the same breath, I would also like to emphasize the point that even if I had said that there was a reason. My boyfriend has this very strong need for me to essentially be overly innocent. He's constantly asking if I'm his first (for anything), always wants me to say he's the only boy I've liked, the only one who's pp (sorry) he's seen etc. And should I have had any kind of experience in any of those things, it would spark major and long arguments. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when he says this, I do that kind of shocked wtf laugh. And I ask him when said the conversation happened. To which he said 2020. Now at this point, I'm actually just at a loss. This is truly the shit I see on those TikTok Reddit stories kind of wild. So now I'm like, ""why were you reading my messages"". Because if it was a conversation from a month ago then okay. But what the hell is up with reading 3 years worth of private conversations with another person? Regardless of what right you think you have to do that, I at least believe anybody deserves the right to at least know beforehand that someone going to go into your account and read that. Unless I'm wrong, someone let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm upset. I'm honestly not as upset at him reading-- but more him having completely disregarded my privacy and pulling a stunt like that to cause an issue out of NOWHERE. And most importantly, doing this without my knowledge. He has the logins to a lot of my social media (if not all), and now I'm beginning to wonder what other things he may have been reading without my knowledge. Just a couple of weeks ago whilst I was asleep I woke up to the notification that someone attempted to log in to my Instagram account whilst I was asleep. My boyfriend is a late sleeper and normally sleeps around 1 am. So naturally I ask him ""Hey, did you try to log in to my account"". He's adamant that he didn't (I didn't even mention the fact that it shows it was from an iPhone in his town) so I drop it. Truly even if he did, I wouldn't be upset because there's nothing on there for me to be securing so it wasn't a big deal to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm honestly at a loss. This turned into a whole ordeal where he was talking about how the conversation made him uncomfortable and how he didn't need to see it. And I'm confused on how to even aid the situation because of the conversation from 3 years ago and he WILLINGLY went to read it. I never forced him to read them, he willingly went into them. Not even to add onto the fact that 3 years ago I wasn't even aware of my boyfriend's existence, so simply the fact that a conversation I had in 2020 can be sparking an argument when it doesn't affect either of us completely floors me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions? More clarity can be given if needed.

My wife, especially the last few months, has been the only thing keeping me going this year. During the pandemic we both lost the majority of our income. I was a bartender and she worked as a part time administrator as well as a live audio engineer. We were incredibly lucky and even though things were incredibly tight I went back to school and my wife went full time at her administration job. The deal was is that I was going to bartend for one more year after graduation, I only needed three semester to graduate, and then I would find a more sustainable job that would help replace both her income and top notch insurance. Well wouldn’t you know it right around the time she is accepted to her graduate program, I get diagnosed with cancer. Now there are worse cancer to get diagnosed with, but this one still blows ass. We have been going through this diagnosis process since the last couple of weeks of 2022. To top this all off, my grandmother had heart surgery two weeks ago and ended up catching a stomach bug bad enough to land her in the hospital. My parents are on a well deserved vacation and since I am about to start chemo next week and can’t risk getting sick my wife is currently staying the night with my sick grandmother at the hospital. I have loved my wife with all of my heart since our first kiss, which was on our first date. She knows who I am, and she accepts me for that. She wakes me up with her snoring and a can’t even get mad anymore cause it’s another opportunity to see her beautiful face at night. She has been gone since eleven this morning and I miss her so bad. I’d slap my mamma if she ever spoke ill of my wife. I’d kick my old man in the nuts if he looked at her the wrong way. Obviously I’m being a little silly right now. Mainly cause I’m writing this during my second margarita and I’m trying not to cry and the Mexican restaurant I’m sitting at right now. But enough of my gushing. I cannot stand the fact that I can not express how much my wife means to me. I have a degree in creative writing but between the painkillers and stress my brain is not letting me be creative enough to figure out a way to show my appreciation to my wife. I would love some help thinking of creative ideas, cheap ones sadly, to help begin to show how much this woman means to me. I know one day it will be my turn to help her through hard times. I have before and I am more than prepared to do that again. But I want her to know now how much she means to me. She is beyond my ability to express.

relationship_advice,"Hey all, I’ve been needing some advice on this because I’m honestly going nuts. 
Let me lay out the story. Might be a long one so bare with me please.

So wife and I dated from 2016-2019, we got married in 2019 and this past October I found out she’d had a 3-4 month long affair with a coworker. (She worked at a coffee shop)
So I guess the past year or so we’d kind of just stopped communicating well and we were basically just acting like roommates, I would go in my office and game when I got home from work, and she would sit in bed and watch Netflix until it was time for us to go to sleep. We continued that pattern for probably close to a year. 

I don’t really know how we ended up getting into that rut, but we just kind of drifted apart, seemed like. She would ask me every now and again to come watch a show with her, or for us to go get dinner or something and I never really wanted to because I’m one of those people who literally hates just sitting in bed and mindlessly watching tv. If I sit In bed and watch tv, the chances of me sleeping well that night are slim to none.  So needless to say I would tell her that and we never really came up with any other plans. 
 
So may of 2022 comes around and we take a trip to “reclaim our relationship” and vow to each other to put each other first. Which honestly worked super well. We were laughing, smiling, making love often, things were good, until October when I found out everything that had happened just a month or two prior to us taking that trip. 

I found out from a journal entry she wrote. I never read her journal before this,but something in my head one day told me that I really need to look in her journal for whatever reason . It was almost like the thought had been burned into my head because it wouldn’t go away. I learned about how she “fell completely in love with him” and how they “connected so well sexually” . I was so mad that I had to call off work the next day because I couldn’t sleep. 

So I confront her about it and at first she lied to me and said nothing happened, then I ask her a couple more times, and then she says that they just kissed. I told her “ I’m not stupid, why would you write that you connected sexually with someone of you never had sex with them?” And she said “connecting sexually doesn’t always mean sex”. So I make her go stay at her friends house for a few days so I can process everything. My neighbor (which is a very good friend of hers) in fact told me that she confided in her that they indeed had sex because she thought she was pregnant by him . 

So I confronted her and told her that and she finally told me that they had sex, but she still lied and told me they only did it once, when really I found out later they did it 3 times. 

I told her I was so hurt and destroyed by this, but since marriage means a lot to me, I’m willing to put in the work to try to move past this. 

What hurt the most was that she was warned by her mom and best friend that she needed to stop talking to the guy before things got out of hand, and she chose to ignore them .

Well fast forward to present day, we’ve  had probably 5-6 therapy sessions so far, and I still feel like I did when I first found out. While I have acknowledged I definitely had a part to play in this, what she did was so wrong. I don’t think it’s something I can ever forget about tbh. I’ve been trying my hardest. But how it all happened, it’s just such a betrayal that I don’t think I can bare anymore .

So I guess I’m asking should I leave? Or should I give it more time and therapy in the hopes that my outlook will change? 

We’ve built a life together and I really don’t want to uproot everything, but man I feel like my mind is going to a dark place because I’m so unhappy and hurt still.",0,"Wife (27f) cheated on me (29m), need help.",r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8865536,1682475984,0,1682475995,1682475996,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,8,755

relationship_advice,"Hi all. I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years. I’ve just realized that he gets angry when I don’t give him a blowjob after he does something nice for me, like takes me out to eat or to see a movie. This makes me feel weird because it’s almost like I have to pay him back for doing something nice? Today we went to see a movie and I usually park at his place and he drives us to the location. When we got to the garage I hugged and kissed him and he goes “you don’t want to go to my apartment?” I said “Oh no I can’t today I told you my brother is flying in tonight so I want to be home before he gets there” and he got super mad and starting getting snappy with me and literally walked away. I texted him when I got home saying how I didn’t appreciate the way he acted. He responds with “I took you to the movies and made sure you had a good day and you couldn’t even give me 10 minutes after?” Why do men always want us to pay them back after they do something nice for us? Why can’t we just go to the movies and end the night with a hug and kiss? Why does everything have to be sexual every single day? That hurt my feelings and made me feel like he just wanted a blowjob and that’s why he hung out with me today.

TLDR: my colleague hates me because I am weaker than she expected, now she is disappointed and is aggressive. What can i do to save our Team work?

  


Five month ago, as I (M36) started in the same Departement as R (F32). At this time we were both in a long time relationship, but unhappy.

  


We had a strong connection from the start on and had a really nice friendship. Then we started flirting. At first, nothing more.

But On one day, we had a deep talk about our past and I felt in love with R. Few weeks later, I broke up with my gf.

  


Then R and I started to try some Restaurants as friends because we are both foodie. One day, I surprised her with a Nature themed restaurant (she is gardening Fan). She liked it very much. We drank much wine there. and since her home was near, she asked me to sleep in her living room and then.. Long Story short, My little man was drunk and could not stand.

  


She messaged me the day after that she is not interested right now in a new relationship.

  


At the work, we had the talk. I told her I have no idea how to handle such a independent woman like her, which Pressured my little man. Afterwards, surprisingly, everything was fine. We worked as usual with our clients, all perfect.

  


Then, she broke up with her Bf. She told me in the same week that she now has to travel somewhere, and I half-joking said Yeah Lets go together on vacation. She agreed and said ""but as friends"". So we booked and went two weeks later. She booked a two bedroom air bnb. The first night was awesome, we were cuddling because she wanted to have me at her bed. On the next morning, we cuddled again. And my man woke up. She felt it and grabbed after it and made movements. So I wanted to get further, but she then denied. My confidence Was destroyed and I was completely confused.

  


The Rest of the Trip, I was nervous, confused, disoriented, Touchy, tried once again and she denied again, saying I do not respect her Wish to go on vacation as friend. I apologized. I feel like I did everything wrong.

  


I noticed during our vacation that she is writing many messages to a guy. In the last night, she went calling some one (that guy) and came back furious. She told me that there is a guy she is seeing and after they booked a Trip, He canceled because she is a strong independent woman and He cannot handle it.

  


Since we are back at work, everytime when I say something, she says things like ""no that's dumb"" in a quiet &amp; unclear voice when she disagree. When my colleagues asks about my opinion, she answers loudly like ""na He is okay with that"".

  


What confuses me additionally: sometimes, she seems to be nice as before, E. G. After my business Trip this week, she saw me, greeted me and said I am looking good today. After few hours, same game with dominance and negative comments.

  


I understand that she is disappointed how I handled during the Trip. But I cannot stand this. What can i do? Should I talk to her? Why does she do that? What can I do to save our friendship/Teamwork?

relationship_advice,"I (25m) broke up with my girlfriend (25f) in January. I need some relationship advice.

TLDR: Broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years 4 months ago, now regretting my decision and wondering whether I should try get her back.

I did it after 6 months of travelling together through Asia which we loved. It was when we finally landed in Sydney and it was time for the adventure to end and find jobs that I did it.

I couldn't find a job so during this time I was staying at home while my girlfriend was going into work. After having a good career back home I felt like I was a little down during this period as I was struggling to make friends and get back into normal working routine.During this time I was also eating into savings to pay my share of rent so it was very stressful.

I made a quick decision to get up and leave. I had friends who were in another part of Australia at the time so I decided to join them. I basically left her on her own with friends she had made while in Australia - part me thought this was ok as she had made a best friend there who I knew would take her (looking back I realise this was selfish of me and not something I should of done)

I think I was chasing the dragon of continuing the travelling adventure as I didn't actually end it for any strong reasons. 

The main reasons were I felt like I wanted to be free and single again, I didn't feel I was ready to commit to potentially marrying her (part of me felt like I wanted to see what a different relationship would feel like as she was my only long term relationship). 

I was feeling a little bit like the spark and that initial crazy love and attraction we had for each other was gone (looking back I think this was normal as we just spent 6 months travelling without much time spent on our own or with friends, so I think we became a little too used to each other and started neglecting the relationship)

I would describe our relationship as your typical young relationship fell madly in love, we were both together 24/7 and very close with each others families. We travelled a lot of the world together during our relationship and had great times. From the outside nobody including my family expected a breakup.

In terms of the relationship we rarely fought (except the odd time when drunk), would be always laughing and had similar interests and values. Towards the end of the relationship I think we both took eachother for granted and stopped doing nice things for eachother. (le at Christmas we were both broke but didn't make an effort to do anything nice for eachother that didn't have to cost anything) (also on her birthday shortly after I had planned a picnic but because of the weather I wasn't able to and I didn't bother with a plan b, instead I ordered pizza and we watched movies but there wasn't anything thoughtful behind it.)

It's been about 4 months since the breakup and I still haven't gotten over her. It actually seems to be getting worse, having dreams about her, waking up in the morning she's on my mind and before bed on my mind.
Initially after the breakup I was excited to see other people and be ""free"" again. Having got with other people I couldn't help but think I'd rather be with my ex.

Now I'm at the phase where I'm not really even interested in dating apps or really getting to know other girls.

I would say since the breakup it's been good in certain ways as I've been focusing on my health, since breaking up I've been focusing on the gym and getting in great shape again.

For some reason as time goes on though I seem to miss her more, now I'm looking back on all the memories we shared and all the things we did thinking of how I took them for granted.

I'm not sure whether I want to risk trying to get back with her (not exactly up to me now either) as l'm afraid of hurting her and myself more as them feelings of wanting to be ""free"" and knowing if I do try get back It's for a life long partner which does kind of scare me.

I feel like I've matured since though and now I'm not seeking short term attention, one night stands and partying but rather what I did have at one stage which was a deep intimate relationship with someone I loved. I suppose I've also realised the grass isn't always greener.

I do think there's a potential for a healthy, long lasting and amazing relationship again with her again.

I'm just not sure whether I should try give it more time and if what l'm going through is a normal phase of a breakup.
I suppose would like some advice on what areas should explore but making a decision to try and get back with her.

relationship_advice,"We’ve been married since we were around 20 years old and she is my absolute best friend. We’ve built a life together over the years with a cozy home filled with our amazing family of pets and our daughter. I can’t imagine ever being in a relationship with anybody else and the thought of losing the life that I have now makes me sick to my stomach. With all that said, I love my wife more than I’ve ever loved anybody, but I don’t feel like I’m starting to not “in” love with her anymore if that makes sense. 

We don’t fight that often, but there are certain topics that are reoccurring fights that we’ve had for years. We fight about it, we say we’ll work on the issues, and then we do for maybe a month or so and then it reverts back to how it was before. Certain things about her (goals/beliefs/values/priorities) have changed over the years that I’m not happy with. When I voice that I am unhappy with how certain thing are, I’m met with “well that’s just how I am and you’ll have to accept it or leave” and I’m not saying I’m perfect, the same thing goes for me. There’s plenty of ways that I have changed that she doesn’t really like, that I can’t really see myself ever changing. I just feel like me and her are both so far removed from who we were at the start of our relationship that we aren’t compatible anymore. 

I think that neither of us are willing to change enough for each other so we aren’t able to give each other the lives that the other wants/deserves. For the last week I’ve felt so emotionally drained and detached that I just feel empty. 

I have all these thoughts that I’ve outlined above, but then I remember my daughter and our home and our whole life and I just get physically ill thinking about throwing that away. Thinking about not being there every day for my daughter makes me so depressed and I feel like I would be being selfish by putting my priorities in front. Like I feel like I should just suck it up, accept how my wife is and go about my life because it’s easier and it makes my daughters life better rather than us splitting up. 

I feel stuck because I’m unhappy, but I know that in order for myself to get out of this unhappy rut, it will derail the lives of everything and everyone around us.",0,"I (28M) love my wife (29F) more than anything, but I feel like I’m not “in” love with her anymore",r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8865391,1682474361,0,1682474372,1682474373,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,20,426

relationship_advice,"I know this topic can go in every which way of a direction. But here we go. We’ve been together for a year. In the beginning we had sex all the time (we can call it our honeymoon phase). But then it stopped. We went from several times a night to once every few weeks. This was within the first two months of dating. I felt so insecure about it but he would blame it on being tired from work or financial stress at the time. Fair but it sucked for me have such a high libido. I started masturbating more before going to sleep which HUGELY upset him. He said it made him uncomfortable doing it right next to him in bed. I don’t understand but I respected his boundary. My insecurities rose as the sex was still infrequent and I thought maybe he was cheating. I went through his phone and saw pornhub in his history from earlier that day. To me, porn is a no. And I’ll just make it clear, going through his phone was not ok at all either. But we had a conversation and I made a boundary for no porn just like he did with me not masturbating. And I don’t watch porn which I do that I just think of him. Cut to now, a year in. Sex is still an issue. There’s always an excuse and he makes no time for it. I had another moment and went through his phone. Pornhub again. The first time we had never discussed it prior to me seeing his search. But this time I can’t help but feel so shattered. All I want is more sex. I haven’t brought up my findings to him this time. I’m trying to healthily cope with it and not take it so personally. But I need some guidance here. I know maybe ignorance is bliss with going through his phone and maybe what I don’t know won’t hurt me. But I feel like I could get there better if my sexual needs were being met.

relationship_advice," Have been dating my bf(26M) for roughly 6 months, and I have semi-stressed and more uncertain about our future together. We both have similar years of job experience, and the only difference is that I have been pretty stable in my job, and making significantly more money than he does, while within the past 6 months, he has gone through lay-off, re-employed, and quitting job cuz he felt he was low-balled by the new company, He is back to job hunting and about to start an online master.

I understand that the current economy is in turmoil, and am by no means judging him being let go. I have been nothing but supportive and understanding throughout all this. But I just think that he is way less dedicated to self-development than me, and lacks goals in his life, which kinda leads to instability in his career. Sometimes I just cannot stand him spending hours on video games and sports, which he could use those time to grow, develop a hobby etc. And he is a lot less active than me, despite being a student-athlete in college. All those are the qualities I value in a partner.

Up to these days, I still have my guard up as I don't think he is equipped with the abilities that make him someone I can fully lean on. Although he is very caring, and patient, and comes from a good family, all and all, it's hard to see a future with him because he cannot provide stability for himself, let alone us.

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I have been dating since in fall 2021. From times to times, he would casually tell me the stories of the girls he used to date before me. He still stays connected with some of these girls and his exes on IG, tho he doesn’t actively talk to them when we started dating officially (that’s what he said). 

Last year, we broke up for a month before summer time. During this time period, he went out with one of these girls for dinner (let’s call her S). According to him, it was not a date, it was like hanging out with a female friend to him. Anyways, the dinner didn’t turn out good. They never talked again after and blocked each other on social media since then. According to my bf, S was being rude and yelling at him at the restaurant. He is glad that S is finally out of his life as he sees her as a crazy person.

Fast forward to earlier this year, I discovered that S and I have a mutual female friend (call her N). N told me that they are actually good friends so out of curiosity, I asked N if she can ask S what really happened at the dinner that day.

This is according to S: one day my bf messaged S and asked her out for dinner. He made a reservation at the restaurant, picked her up and drove her to the restaurant. During the conversation, S was trying to talk about her dead cat story, but he interrupted her 3 times (like when she was trying to tell the story, he was like “oh hey there is a parking spot” or “omg this food is so good!”), which S found it very rude. At the table, he told S that he recently ended a relationship and he didn’t want to use dating app anymore, but wanted to see if he could start a potential romance with people around him (aka female friends). At this point, S felt like she was being used, like option B or something, so she stared snapping at him. Then he asked to split the bill, and she thought it was ridiculous because he asked her out initially and even made the reservation, so he should pick up the bill but he didn’t, which she thinks he was being stingy. After he dropped her off, she blocked him on IG because she doesn’t want to see him anymore. S thinks he is a psychopath and is inconsiderate and self-centred with no empathy.

Later on, I confronted with my bf and he tried to clarify a few things. About turning a friendship into a relationship, he said she heard it wrong. He explained that he said he wanted to go out and meet people in real life, maybe he would meet girls at climbing area and they could probably start being friends first before it could get developed into some kind of romance. About the dead cat story, he said he just doesn’t know how to comfort someone and he is the worst person to deal situations like this. He said he didn’t want to talk about the dead cat story the whole time. He swore that he only considered her as a friend at that time. 

There are certain things I agree with S but not everything. I think calling him a psychopath is a bit much, but can probably understand her anger. 

Fast forward to now, I recently talked to N and jokingly asked N that if S is willing to show me around when I solo travel to Korea in May (S is currently in Korea). N said S is willing to host me but is worried that my bf wouldn’t be happy if he knows. Originally, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to let my bf know, but he saw me I was texting N so he asked what we were talking about so I told him. Then he got really upset and started yelling that S is manipulative and has no good influence on me. He said she drinks and eats edibles every night and she might influence me to get unnecessary surgeries. She might say bad things about him and try to jeopardize our relationship. At this point, I felt he was being over dramatic. To me, “what happened between them” and “me potentially hanging out with S” are two different things. I see S as my friend’s friend. N thinks S and I would get along very well as we are all straightforward and direct.

I told N what my bf said to me, and of course N told S what happened. S said my bf was just one of the guys she dated in the past, they only kissed and cuddled but nothing more. To her, my bf is not that important and she doesn’t want me to talk about him at all. I told N that my intention is only to have a good time in Korea and it would be nice to hang out with friend’s friend since I’m traveling solo. There is no point for me to talk about my bf with her because I see no values added to everyone. 

I told my bf that he is very wrong about S and he shouldn’t try to portray her as a bad person. Then he started saying how I don’t value the relationship and don’t hold the fundamentals and don’t respect him. As soon as he said the word “fundamentals”, I just snapped. I asked him what are the fundamentals, he said 1) he dated this girl before 2) this girl calls him a psychopath, so he doesn’t feel comfortable that I’m going to hang out with her. 

So I started bringing up how he still stays connected with his exes. One of his exes messaged him last fall how he was doing. He told her that he was travelling with me at the time and she left him on read for almost 2 weeks before she responded. I found it rude when someone leaves another person on read but my bf tried to find some excuses for her and just allowed this ex to do this to him. And it also made me a bit uncomfortable when they still talk online. Anyways, I use this as an example to define the “fundamentals (aka don’t let exes have any chance to talk to me and disturb my life)” and said he doesn’t even respect me and value this relationship when he is still in contact with his ex(es). Then he said “what do you want me to do? Block them on social media? I’m not going to do that. And these are just your fundamentals!” so I fired back “okay so the fundamentals you said a mins ago are just yours too!” At this point, he gave up to argue with me and we just let things drop.

My bf thinks it’s so weird that I want to hang out with the girl he used to date, and I told him it’s weird that he still talks to his exes when he is with me and stays connected with girls he dated (or had a fling with) before on IG . His argument is that these girls always initiate the conversations first and he never initiates (side eye for sure). I admit unconsciously I’m making a passive protest because of the lingering in his past….",0,Is it weird to hangout with the girl that my (34F) bf (42M) used to date?,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8865309,1682473337,0,1682473348,1682473349,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,16,1253

Okay so I have a huge fucking crush and I'm not sure what to do about it. Well, that's a lie. I know that I should ask him out. Regardless of the outcome, it would bring me peace of mind, and it would be a ""hey I did this thing I should be proud of that"" moment.

However, I have a few concerns, the first being that I am a university student and it is finals season. I'm busy, he's busy. This could be an added stressor, especially if he rejects me. I have set up my semester quite well, but there are some classes where I could either get an A or a B and I would prefer the A. The second is that he will be in classes with me until I graduate. Yes, I would have the summer to recover if he did reject me, but then I would see him in my classes and would feel some type of way until a new crush came up and the cycle repeated. The third is that I have no idea what I would do in a relationship with him. Like, maybe this is just a proximity crush? Maybe I just want him to be my friend? I see him five days a week, we occasionally text, he's in a few of my group chats, and I think we have an inside joke?

I just think very highly of this person. He's smart, he has a passion for what he does, and he makes me laugh. I just don't want to ruin anything and I feel like I have been a bit awkward and maybe giving him mixed signals. He also does a thing where he'll be looking in my direction, then I'll notice and make eye contact with him, then he'll immediately look away. My brother said that this is just a thing guys do, they'll just start thinking about something and not realize that they're looking at someone. I feel like this has happened too many times to be that, though.

Should I go ahead and ask him out, regardless of finals and personal responsibilities? Is it better to wait until the fall, to see if maybe this is just a proximity crush that I can get over?",0,Should I (21 F) ask a guy (21 M) out,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,8865194,1682472215,0,1682472230,1682472230,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,10,381

With the end of our relationship came no contact, my learning a lot about rumors surround him, a lot of crying, his friends finding out, them kicking him out of the friend group, and a lot of loneliness on his end. 

He ended up reaching out to me asking him about his friends. After a long talk, I told him I wanted us to be acquainted but not friends. That lasted for a day lol. He unfollowed me on Instagram and it completely broke me. I went to him and asked him if that’s what he thought was part of not being friends.

I(25f) am a middle child, so my mom always favored my older sister (28f), who is her mini me, and my younger sister (18f).

My mom's uncle (65m) abused my mom when she was living with him before she was 18, but my mom didn't tell me that. I moved in with him when I was 18 and found out the hard way.

Pls help me. In February I had a house fire unfortunately, I work 3 jobs my main job I work from home. Due to water damage I was informed I can not stay there until the repairs are complete, was so hard and unfortunate. Gratefully- I had been talking to a man since December, he insinuated he wanted to date me but some things he did gave me the ick a little so I tried ending things early February and made him aware why- but for the month of February we continued talking, I let him know how I felt, he kept tryna see me but nothing came of it. We talked on the phone almost daily, so fast forward to after the fire, he was the one and only person I wanted to call aside from my siblings. He immediately begged me to come stay (he had been tryna see me for a month). I didn’t end up going but the following Monday I learned I would not be able to stay home, and he begged me to come stay with him. (He does not have a car) and I very much feel I can’t let someone help me without helping them- so I went to his house in exchange to not feel guilty I let him drive my car to and from work and where ever he wanted, until my house was repaired while I ignored my 2 other jobs. One night I decide to do a Amazon route, I finish and call and ask what he wants for dinner as I was goin to stop at the store ~ while on the expressway my car just fckn dies……. dead. I call mdot wait an hour freezing on side of the expressway with my dog, with no help. I eventually call an Uber he calls his AAA to have it towed, and I was SO appreciative. CONTEXT - I have had my car for 1 year since January (warranty expired by 2 months) it has 110,000 miles on it. Mechanic tells me it needs a new engine. Have it towed elsewhere, same thing. (Series of unfortunate events smh how) I work 3 jobs to survive, so unfortunately I can not pay to have it repaired. 

This man has been telling me since we met he wants to be in a relationship with me. After coming here, I’m expecting exactly that. He continues telling me we’re “building a relationship” I’m not stupid right so imma hold him to it. So it’s been a month without a car, in this time- I learned 1 night when he kicked me out to have “cousins night” he actually had his ex over to have sex. I caught him “stroking” his d to a “dancing” video of his ex, I’ve heard them have a few conversations that made me uncomfortable enough to leave / snap. Beyond that, I have seen him texting other women who are “friends” and he stay tryna tell me he’s “private / my family doesn’t share things or names like that”

Moral of the story- I have no where else to go. I can’t even help myself rn. And today after talking to my sister I walk down the hallway to see him swiping on bumble…. I call him out and he says he is cancelling a subscription. I’m not dumb. You wouldn’t swipe to cancel a mf subscription. Pls help me. I have to stay here till my house is done. Being around this man had made me beyond obsessed. How can I navigate these last few weeks in a successful way. I tried sleeping on the couch, he would come get me. I tried acting psycho, and like a child of god- ain’t shit changed. Pls help me given the circumstances- aside from side bs I been acting like a wifey, cooking, cleaning, givin him sloppy bjs and the best 🐱 every night. What do I do??!!!!!! I like him so much it’s evident he don’t give a rats flying ass about me. What do I do??!!!

So here’s the thing. I (18f) have a best friends (19f) of 5 years and I love her a lot. But lately, things have been getting weird. I feel like people will call me childish for what I’m about to say, but read the whole thing first.

She’s copying me to the point where I’m concerned if she even wants to be herself anymore. It’s been happening for a while, but I didn’t take it seriously at first because someone copying you can mean nothing plus people are allowed to have the same things as others. But here are a list of things that have me…creeped out:

1. She explicitly stated that she “wants to live through me.” Now, when she said this, I admit that I laughed it off, but something inside me was screaming wtf. I thought maybe she wants to be involved in my life more or she’s just being a good best friends…but nah.
2. Every time I bring up a new guy (not a lot dw) she seems to never like them or says things that makes it seem like she wants us to break up. I had a boyfriend a few months back and we dated for 1 year and 4 months and she didn’t seem to like him. Mind you, she met him one time and he never did anything to seem like a bad guy, but she always had it out for him. 
3. I recently got a new boyfriend who treats me wonderfully and she sent me a TikTok that was about “waiting for the downfall of your friend’s boyfriend so you can buy a wedding dress”. I thought this was very rude because it was as if she was expecting my new boyfriend to be horrible person. My man is sweet, amazing, lovely and extremely attractive. I was feeling mad about the TikTok she sent so I ask her “what are you doubts about (boyfriend’s name)” and she said she has no idea. After that I said ”great”. Pretty sure she realized that I was in a bad mood. 
4. Everything I do, she wants to do as well. And you might be saying “well she’s your best friend, so of course she wants to do what you do” but no. Listen. I got a new laptop and iPad. She has a perfectly working laptop and the other night, she asked me to send her the information and details about my laptop and iPad because she wants the exact same ones. I got pink braids and she got them a few days later. Seems like innocent stuff, but it’s gets weird after a while. I would never go to this extent to copy someone. I got new headphones and she made me take her to the store to get the same ones. 
5. (In university now) But back in high school, this guy that the whole school had a crush on liked me and she liked him. I liked him too, but we never fought over him or anything. She found it so hard and dreadful that this guy liked me more than her and I would catch her giving me weird looks. Mind you, I never jumped at him or anything cause I was chill about it. But him and I would be having a conversation and she would jump in and start flirting, pulling her shirt up and doing the most. She would continue going overboard when I didn’t give her the reaction she wanted. 
6. Oh and the worst one of all. She wanted to hear about the intimate acts between my boyfriend and I in extreme detail and I was so uncomfortable with her asking in the first place…When she sensed I was uncomfortable, she tried to say she was kidding, but it was obvious that she wanted to hear about it. 

She’s really supportive of me as I’ve won multiple scholarships and awards, but I can sense a bit of jealously. I’m not the type to show off because I’m very down to earth and don’t brag about stuff like that. 

Lately, down to 2 days ago, when she came over to my house, I caught her giving me dirty looks. I’m concerned and creeped out now. She done some other weird things but I forgot some. My mother even noticed how much she copies me y’all. 

So, am I overreacting or do I have the right to be concerned by this?",0,Advice needed! Best friend (19f) is copying me (18f),r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8865117,1682471415,0,1682471426,1682471426,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,9,756

relationship_advice,"I am not sure why I feel so insecure around my husband, I don't mean in regards to my body, but when other women who are half to nearly naked come on the screen.

I feel extremely uncomfortable when he looks at female nudity, so we do not even watch movies like that or we tend to forward through it. Once I see that he saw it, I go down this toxic mental rabbit hole and my body language changes and I just get upset. I also do not feel comfortable with him viewing porn, so he said he has stopped awhile ago. But always in the back of my mind I wonder if he does and hides it. I did catch him lying to me about it a few times in the past, so that is why it is hard to believe him.

He said he quit and I want to believe him but there is so much temptation out there. I know the problem is me, I do not know why I get so triggered.

For additional context and not to be woe is me, I was also sexually abused when I was 5 years old, so that definitely hurt me and I was also raised in a super strict and conservative household so I am not sure if that is why but I am working through that.

But I don’t care about the way at this point, I want advice, and please be kind, I am being vulnerable and I know to some women this is not a big deal, but for me it is. I want to be better and do better.

relationship_advice,"I’ve been talking to this guy for about a month. We’re both 18 in our first year of university.

I’ve already become attached (stupid I know) but I really can’t help it. It feels like we’re a really good match; we’re extremely similar, good chemistry and humour and we’re very affectionate with each other. He’s already mentioned making me his girlfriend which definitely doesn’t help my attachment.

I had a guy I was FWB with but stopped about a month before I met the new guy. Neither of us had feelings for each other it was just sexual.

I’ve had sex with my new guy twice now and I got tested since he’s a new partner and we didn’t use protection (I know, I know.) and it turns out I have chlamydia. I’ve told both partners and the old FWB said he’s gotten tested and hes clean (though I really don’t believe him.) 

I told the new guy yesterday and he was completely fine about it. Didn’t shame me or be judgmental about it. He’s getting tested soon. However, today he called me and said he doesn’t think we should be seeing each other anymore, and that my results have been bothering him.

I know feelings can change, but he should’ve told me he wasn’t okay with it beforehand. I just feel ashamed and I feel like I’ve ruined it all for myself.

He said that I should’ve told him I was getting tested beforehand (which I did??) But obviously I understand that I put him at risk so I don’t blame him at all.

I just don’t know what to do. I’m already attached and crying over a relationship that never even happened. I feel horrible knowing I put him at risk but there’s nothing I can do but apologise which I’ve done multiple times.

relationship_advice,"So the story is actually somewhat complicated and involves 2 women and I'm in real a pickle.

First, 2 months ago I matched and started talking  to a nice girl 24F,  I'll call her Amy, for about 3 weeks. Initially we had great chemistry and I asked her out after a week of talking. She says yes and I planned to take her to dinner the next weekend. 

The day of our first date came and she asked to reschedule to the following weekend, I think she claimed to have had prior plans she forgot about,  which was no biggie. Next weekend came though and again she canceled, I can't remember the exact reason but she said she had to head out of state to go back home. 

Texting has already started to slow by this point and soon she mostly stopped responding, so I took the hint and let her be. 

Maybe 2 weeks after that,  an old friend 25F, we'll  call Britney, she hit me up after 5 years of no contact and we got chatting and I've been lonely won't lie, so i decided to be spontaneous and fly her out to my city for a 5 day mini vacation about a month out. 

Britney lives in LA I live in NYC, we met when I was out there for a work trip 5 years ago,  exchanged numbers but it never moved past that just taking before i went home to NY. She was ecstatic when I bought her the ticket and told me she would love to visit me and always dreamed of visiting NYC but could never afford it. 

Anyway the following week after i bought Britney's ticket out here, Amy actually reached out and said she had a family emergency, which is why she went to her hometown so abruptly. She apologized for falling off the map  but said it was handled and she was back in town, and she wanted to know if I still wanted to go out. 

Britney and I had only ever been friends at that point, so I saw no reason to say no to Amy and I went on the date. 

What followed was hands down one of the most amazing first dates I've ever had. Amy was incredibly stunning in person, super sweet and we just clicked.  I've seen her every weekend since and we text all day everyday, it's been about a month. We've taken it slow though, a lot of  kissing but no title and no sex yet. 

The problem is it's now nearing  the date Britney is supposed to come. Since buying the ticket Britney has texted me a lot more also and she made it clear that she really likes me, she told me she has thought about me for a long time and she's also really wanted to visit my city. She's told her whole  family how amazing I am for flying her out negate it was her dream to visit here.

She's also implied heavily that she plans to have sex with me. She sends revealing pictures even though i don't ask. Early on I went along with it and flirted back as well, I was deff looking forward to her coming. But now I'm not because I definitely feel a stronger connection with Amy, plus she lives here. I stopped flirting back with Britney and try to keep it platonic, especially after my second date with Amy.

I'd be happy to have Britney out here still, just as a friend, and show her the city, but I feel like it's hard to put  the geni back in the bottle once you've already  talked about sex. My apartment is small so we'd  have to share my bed whether we have sex or not. 

I could just make up an excuse for why I can't see Amy this weekend and show Britney the time of her life,  before sending her home for good. But that feels dishonest to Amy, even though we aren't dating yet. In my heart I want to cancel on Britney, but I don't want to hurt her and I know it will. I wish Amy had just explained she had a family emergency before falling off the map.

relationship_advice,"I am 25 years old, but I stopped having a curfew just last year (if that puts things into perspective). My parents are Asian, conservative, and are so afraid of people gossiping about us. They know it's inevitable, but it is like they want to control every detail in their life to influence what people think of us. I became a registered nurse and for over a year, I had been paying the full rent for my family. With that, I had told them that it would make it easier for them to pay off their debt and they agree after they paid it off, they would help me. A year goes, where I still feel like I haven't made any progress, and when I had asked for help with money, they would tell me all of the things that they still need to pay. They tell me what they tell other people, giving me credit for their ability to travel and etc. It honestly felt like the biggest guilt trip. At first, the whole talk was like a big issue when I had asked for help. They told me it was like I was putting it to their face that I pay the full rent. Rent nowadays is really expensive. They are right in terms of me moving out, I'd be paying what I'm paying ~1600 and more. But it didn't make sense anymore that I'm paying for it all, when life will always have more expenses to come and I do not see my account growing. That's disappointing, isn't it? Well, after the initial ""anger"", my mom eventually settled, apologized and realized that it is disappointing to go to work and not see my bank grow day in and day out. They agreed to help pay rent, hence why I haven't moved out.


Anyway, the real issue here is my freedom. Even when it came to guys, if my parents don't Iike them, they don't like them. Well, my mom specifically. My dad wants whoever makes me happy. There is this guy I had met last year and he introduced himself to my parents prior to meeting me. We got along very well. My mom didn't like him - she said he was loud, he looked homeless and etc. Unfortunately, he was planning on moving to another province the month after I met him, so we took things slow, continued to go on dates but did not pursue anything further. Less than a year later, he messages me out of the blue saying he will be moving back later this summer and we reconnected. When I told my mom I had reconnected with this guy, let's name him John, she was completely repulsed and said ""NO. I don't like him. You're like a horse jumping from one to another. It's like you're so desperate.""  I didn't even know what to say, so I hung up. After I stayed in my room for a bit, she came to apologize. If John made me happy, so be it. That also came with a cost too, though. She'd say ""if I don't like your husband, I'm not visiting you. No way."" Shit like that that makes me feel so confused and guilty. John, he is aware of everything and still has absolutely nothing against them due to the fact he knows their mindset is just different. So despite my mom's wishes, I started dating him long distance. My sister has a wedding in August, and John had planned to come. Mind you, I haven't seen John since last year.. and a part of me wanted new adventure. A part of me wanted to spend time with him before I introduce him to people in such an intimate, familial setting. I planned to visit him this May. I have never traveled by myself, but this is what I want. I had told my family, my dad remained stoic, only saying ""mom won't like that."" He remained quiet throughout the car ride. By the time I came home, I had told my mom, ""I'm not asking you, I'm just telling you.  I'm going to visit John in May."" My mom just blew up in anger, ""why can't you just wait til he is here? I haven't even met him. I only met him once. I don't know him. You don't care about anyone but yourself. We care about your welfare but you don't care about us."" The trip I was planning was only going to be for four days since I do work full time. She got so angry that she ended the conversation ""I don't care what you do now. You do whatever you want to do."" I haven't spoken to either of my parents since. There's a part of me that knows that THIS is not normal. I'd like to think my older sister (28) is scared of my parents. Even at her age, shes double thinking about what she can or cannot do - her marriage giving her leniancy now. They think of me as a rebellion because I make my own decisions, whereas my mom wants to make the decisions for us, if she thinks we are making the ""wrong"" choice. I'm still visiting John. At the end of the day, that's what I want. I wanted my parents to be supportive of me. I wanted my parents to be there if and when I make a mistake - but what life would I be living if I were to be a child to them all my life until they can't make the decisions for me anymore? I don't know. My parents, even my sisters, will tell me I'm the one rebellious. I'm the one who's in the wrong of what I want to do.

relationship_advice,"i’ll keep it short and simple, our whole relationship is very nuanced and complicated. 

him (21m) and i (20f) have been together exclusively for about 9 months but we moved in together before we decided we were exclusive. we don’t have problems at all really, we have great communication and all but i’m on the spectrum and have very bad anxiety so i tend to overthink and read between the lines when there isn’t much to be revealed. 

we started living together about a year ago for some financial reasons and for work purposes. it’s honestly been amazing and it’s starting to look up for me and i won’t be needing a place to stay for much longer. unfortunately i have really bad attachment issues when it comes to relationships (childhood trauma/BPD). i started therapy a while ago but of course things like that take time. i’m so nervous about moving out, i’m worried it’ll damage our relationship or cause him to drift away from me and as a bi-product make him seek out satisfaction from other women. i’m scared we won’t have our cute sleepovers anymore even though he says we absolutely will. 

i know he isn’t as scared as i am because he’s wildly independent and has healed from the bullshit he’s been through and i haven’t. i know i can talk to him about this with no problems but i don’t know how to articulate it in a way that’s not going to sound pathetic. any advice is appreciated.

relationship_advice,"***tl;dr:*** After a night of drinking, my boyfriend and I had an intense discussion where he said that my opinion of him wasn't all that important when I asked him if he thought I care about him. I am having a hard time getting over it, and my feelings for him have changed somewhat, but I don't want to end things over something that could potentially change over time. I don't know how to navigate my feelings at this moment. Help?

&amp;#x200B;

So recently, him and I got into a bit of an argument/intense discussion (he had been drinking a lot) regarding how he's been feeling lately. He's pretty stressed out about work, life, etc. We had talked about everything again and for the most part, things aren't exactly ""settled"" but we at least know where each other stands on each issue. Except 1. During the discussion, I had asked him if he thinks that I care about him. Not out of some selfish fantasy where I become his savior or anything, but because I want to know if I am doing everything to make sure he feels cared for overall, and where I can improve. 

Well basically his response was ""Your opinion of me is low on the things I am concerned about. You're not the mother of my kids, your not my life partner (at least yet). So that stuff doesn't really mean much to me right now"".

I can't lie, I was hurt by it. Not even because I think the words are completely wrong -- we have only been dating for less than a year, so I can't expect him to think that my opinion matters over any and everything. But, I guess how I was approaching the relationship was that my partner's opinion of me matters a lot and that I do value how they feel about me. His words to me made me feel like how I feel doesn't matter and he doesn't care about me that much. Perhaps I am overdramatic, but I definitely see him in a different light right now.

Whereas before, I felt the need to be the loving girlfriend and had admittedly a bad anxious attachment to him. Now, in my mind, we have taken several steps back and I feel like I am talking to little more than a stranger. It could be because we haven't had a very romantic or intimate moment since we argued, but idk...

Part of me wants to just care less. Like the words ""I love you"", I feel so much less interested in saying. I feel like I have made mistakes, but overall I tried to be caring, kind, funny, etc. Now it just feels like I shouldn't extend myself that much, and almost like his words of affection have been a lie. We haven't been texting much, and honestly, I really don't know what to say to him. Like I said, right now I feel like I am talking to a stranger. But I am still scared to confront him about it and risk the relationship ending.

Recently I begged her to just come home and I would help her get clean and I told her to put everything on the table and stop lying about using and where she's been and stuff like that and she promised she would but the next day I caught her hiding more stuff and I texted her about it upset and she never came home after work and now it's been a month and I haven't seen or heard from her not even one time not even a text and that has never happened in five years we have always been very close. I found out that her drug dealer has been trying to sleep with her and she's been around him more and now I'm scared that because she started using harder drugs she may have cheated on me with him because that's what it looks like and I was told by someone that seen her in a car with him. I'm extremely worried about her just in general from not hearing from her in a month it's never happened before and I was under the impression we were going to get clean and get married and I still want that because I believe she is the love of my life we are so happy together when we are doing good but the drugs ruined things recently and now she's been gone for a month and idk if she's been with that other guy which would destroy any chance of us staying together and also I'm just worried about her safety.

I got sick of this and one of my guy friends at the time was clearly interested in me so I flirted with him pretty openly in front of the loml (to make him jealous ofc) and then broke things off with him the next day (did this poorly). 

He avoided me for years. We got back in touch a couple years ago (I initiated several times). At this point, I find out that the loml thought we were dating so looking back its like I openly cheated, rubbed it in his face, then dumped him like an asshole. I apologized twice and he accepted it both times saying he was the one who should be sorry. Which I still don't understand why he was apologizing back bc I don't think he did anything? I am just so confused by him. He called me on valentines day to wish me a happy valentines which felt sweet and I really thought he was going to ask me out after. We talk sort of frequently but he's inconsistent and I feel like I initiate a lot. 

Anyways the reason I am even posting here is because he will never say good night back to me when were hanging up to go to bed which is really bothering me!!!!  He will always say something else like talk to you later or something. I am not sure if he thinks me saying that is romantic? and If so, then im hurt bc he's rejecting me although tbh I know he doesn't like me like that and never did...

I kind of know the answer but I am delusional and refuse to believe it and he is also just super confusing!! I feel like I am being breadcrumbed should I just ghost him forever :( Part of me feels like I never got over him bc he's so confusing. he shows no interest in me - when we (he) talk on the phone he can literally talk for hours without realizing I haven't said a word and extremely rarely asks about me. 

tl;dr: the guy I briefly talked to years ago and never got over still hasn't fallen in love with me, when do you think he will get around to doing that?

relationship_advice,"Howdy everyone, so like the title says I'm struggling between feeling taken for granted and like I'm totally overreacting. My boyfriend and I have been together over a year now and I know he cares about me, but sometimes I feel like I'm not really a priority. He starts work at 7 am every morning (works on the trading floor) so I know it's an intense, high pressure job, but it essentially means week-day visits are limited to the occasional dinner or run together and he's home by 9 pm to go to bed. He also has a hectic social calendar at times. He's been traveling (which is totally fine and I support) and has been helping his family out with some things (which again, I totally get) but it's effectively meant we haven't spent a single night together in over 3 weeks and have only actually hung out a handful of times during that period.

I know he’s not seeing other people, nor am I being hidden. We hang out with family once a month or so. 

He's not much of a texter, so I feel even more disconnected from him. I have brought it up and he's apologized and says he understands and misses me too, but he hasn't taken any action to resolve it or carve out more time for me. I'm trying to rationalize it and understand that people are just busy but I'm worried this could mean we're not compatible or worse, that he IS taking me for granted; however on the flip side, I could just be overreacting and needy?

relationship_advice," TLDR: My husband has not shown me much affection or wanted any intimacy since I started showing this pregnancy. He crossed boundaries on social media and was being not entirely faithful over DM. I'm struggling to figure out if/how we can reconnect and re-establish some intimacy in general.

My (25F) husband (25M) and I have been together for about 3 years, married for 2, and are pregnant with our first child. We had SUCH an electric connection, I just never had to worry about him not wanting me. We had an incredible sex life, and were super close emotionally as well. He is my absolute best friend, and generally speaking is a really good partner. However, I am late into my third trimester, and I am feeling SO defeated. Our intimacy is completely gone, and has been basically since the moment I started showing. There are a few factors at play here:

1. My husband started anti-depressants and medication to suppress his alcohol cravings around then too.
2. He is working about 80hrs/week between work and school.
3. He has relapsed recently, although is back to being sober and attending AA/therapy again.

We've talked about this several times and it's always just ""I'm not in the mood"" or some other reason. I initiated it constantly, and while he's never shut me down, I get tired of not feeling wanted either, so I stopped. Other than a few hugs and kisses when he's leaving or randomly if we're sitting together, there is quite literally NOTHING going on. I can't help but feel he isn't attracted to me, although he SWEARS that isn't the issue. The problem is, a few weeks ago I caught him liking provocative videos on TikTok, and engaging in not-so-great behavior with a few random girls via DM on TikTok as well. Truthfully, I don't know what the messages said, I didn't want to know and honestly I'm glad I don't know. I saw the message come in, and I immediately confronted him. He took full responsibility immediately, apologized profusely, blocked them all, and deleted the app. I can tell he felt bad and we're working on those issues as well, and honestly I wouldn't overly care so much about the thirst traps (although I'd care about the DMs regardless) if I knew that he was attracted to me too, but I just don't feel like he is. I'm incredibly insecure and I've spoken to him about this a number of times, and it just doesn't seem to change. He just keeps defaulting to the medicine, saying he has no sexual thoughts, and just no overall feeling to do anything. I just can't imagine that's the case if he's engaging in behavior like that on social media, you know? Like why not put that effort into me? I feel like when we go lay in bed, I will just try to snuggle with him and just like be close to him and I can literally feel him tense up. It almost feels like he's scared I'm actually going to initiate things lol. I just keep telling myself that things will go back to normal after the baby is here, but that just doesn't feel fair. It's been like this for 4+ months, and I worry that if that's the case, I'm going to resent him because I wasn't good enough while I was literally growing the child we planned and tried for.

I just miss him. I miss the romance in our relationship. I miss the chemistry we had before, I fear it's never going to come back. I worry that while he loves me, he isn't IN love with me anymore, like somehow his perspective has changed, like I can't even remember the last time he complimented me without me ""fishing"" for it or complimenting him first. I just want our spark back but I don't want to be the only one trying. Every time I bring this up he does seem genuinely apologetic and says that he's going to try, but his actions just never seem to follow. I'm tired and just annoyed, hurt, frustrated, and overall I'm just REALLY lonely. I know that he also needs to heavily focus on his sobriety, so I'm trying to allow him space to do so without me piling our relationship stuff on top of it too. I'm trying my best to give him some slack and allow him the chance to grow and focus on himself, but I'm not the only one in this marriage and I just feel SO alone.

relationship_advice,"Long Distance With Constant Anxious Attachment Issues

Hi, F (20) and M (21) are in a relationship. Im from the US while my boyfriend is from the Netherlands. We’ve been dating for only 4 months, however, things have went pretty fast. 

For background, we started off things not serious, despite me wanting something more but him saying no, but well, here we are. For reference, I am his first girlfriend, as he was previously into hookup culture (relevant? idk?, but it does bother me). Anyway, I have anxious attachment style, and according to him, I have a victim mindset, where I put a lot of blame on my problems (like the stress of premed, my rocky relationship with my mother, etc). We fight quite often about small things, but sometimes the small fights turn into big ones, especially when he mentions something about not being together, like “if you have another boyfriend” or “if we break up”. It sort of triggers my anxiety and I think it’s a implication that he will leave. In general, I’ve been pretty good about it, but I’ve needed constant reassurance about things. I visited him for a quick weekend trip this weekend, and as both of our families are polish (they don’t speak English), I spoke with them in polish. I haven’t spoken very often since I was small, and although I’m essentially fluent, I’m aware that sometimes I directly translate from English since I’m forgot how to properly form grammatically correct sentences (polish grammar is super complicated, ok). Anyway, he mentioned to me yesterday that they didn’t understand probably half of what I said. I kind of spiraled and said that I’m ashamed that I even spoke with them, as I’ve been trying and taking lessons to learn again. I have also asked him to speak polish with me but he’s afraid to because his parents might find out what we’re talking about. Anyway, from that I also felt like it would be better if I wasn’t his girlfriend, as I feel like he deserves a real polish girl. I always seem to have this: he mentions something I’m insecure about, and I feel like I should leave before he leaves me and finds someone am with said attribute. 

Also, throughout the beginning and up until now, he’s wanted to marry me, saying I’m the one. In the beginning, I was really concerned: it’s been a very short time and well, i was the first, as well as long distance. Nevertheless, I fell deeper in love with him. He visited me for a week in March, and impulsively wanted to move to the US, and suggested we get married and he can finish school here (despite his school being paid for there). A week later, after almost finishing the application, he backed out saying it was a bad idea and he should continue his schooling. I knew it was the right choice. However, it triggered my anxiety really badly, I thought it was a sign that he didn’t love me as much, somewhat of a level down from breaking up. 

We kinda figured out a plan anyway: I would (maybe) take a gap year from college to medical school next year (taking MCATs and applying in May, just in case) and with this we would get married then so I could live with him, and he would come to me after he finished schooling and we’d apply for American visa. Honestly, I’ve been concerned about taking a gap year unless I get rejected. After our meeting this weekend, I really considered taking one as his village and parents were very nice. I felt like I fit in. However, today he expressed his doubts about getting married, saying he doesn’t want to because we haven’t lived together and we’re young (totally valid!). However, this with the combined thing of him telling me that I’m boring because I don’t know what I want to do and he’s tired of making decisions for me, sent me into panic mode. I kept asking if he fell out of love, why his mind changed, etc. I also felt like my security of taking a gap year potentially was gone, since he could break up with me in a blink of an eye. I told him this and he got furious, saying he’s sick of my paranoia, I’m acting crazy, and he said he doesn’t even want to have a partnership, or any papers binding us. 

While I respect his decision, and I pushed it too far, I feel like my anxiety is getting the best of this relationship, I’m constantly in fear of when he brings something up, he wants to break up, or if I take a gap year, he’ll leave me in the end. Do I need to seek professional help? Any advice (for both parties)?

So I had this sort of nothing relationship a while back. I know it was the weekend of my birthday meaning it was beginning to mid October. 

There was this woman (F18) that I (M18) was talking to and even though it wasn’t much of anything, I fell in love with her. She pretty much ended things (even though things weren’t official) and I was pretty hurt, but it was worsened even more so when I found out she would just lead me on for a bit while hitting on my best friend then come back to me. She did it a few times. 

For the first 2-3 months things were so fucking hard. So hard. It was the most depressed I’ve ever been. There were a couple of other women I tried pursuing and they didn’t work out. Then I thought I was finally over her. So I started getting myself back out there again, but nothing would work out and every time something didn’t work out, I’d put myself in a pit for a day or two before repeating the process.

Finally I stopped doing this and realized I didn’t need anyone. But I still pursued a couple of people. Once again, none of them worked out, but I wasn’t majorly bothered. Until today. I started thinking. I still see my “ex” quite frequently though we never talk and things ended on bad terms. Every time I see her, a quick wave of emotion passes me and vanishes. I see that she still has no care or compassion for me. That she never has and never will. And I’m okay with that because I’m way better off without her. But it still makes me a little upset. And every time I hear Camp by Childish Gambino or Blond by Frank Ocean, all of the emotions come back. Like they did now. Am I over my ex? Is this normal?

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend (early 20s) and I (early 20s) have been seeing each other for almost a year. We go to college together. I am a domestic student, he is international. We are both each other's first relationship and we love each other very much. I've known from the start that he will have to go back home after the end of his degree. We don't want to do long-distance and it wouldn't make sense for me to move down there at the current stage in our relationship. He's leaving in December and we have agreed that we'll have to break up. It's possible he'll come back to my country for grad school, but it's also possible that he finds a good job and ends up staying back home.

I feel like I am already going through the breakup, even though we have several months to go. I feel grief and I am heartbroken. I am acting out and taking it out on him because of the pain I feel. I know its not rational, but I can't help but feel like he is rejecting me if he chooses to stay in his home. That I am not enough and that he would choose a job over me.

tl;dr Want someone to give me advice on how to cope with a relationship that will end due to distance

relationship_advice,"Hey there, (23m)

Just got out of a long relationship with a really awesome person 3 weeks ago. Mutual break up that we both saw coming and finally came to an end. 

Anyway, started to talk to an old friend (22F) from almost 4 years ago / senior year of highschool. We started to hit it off immediately again and clicked right when i picked her up. Had a great night on the beach, hot tub, and ended with sex. Super passionate sex and very unexpected that it was going to to be like this. 

I noticed some things she said during sex for example “ive missed you so much” , “ive been waiting for this for years” , “oh crap, i hope you dont mind but im about to get really clingy, i hope you dont mind” etc… which made me have the impression she enjoyed it as much as i did and maybe wanted to see me again. Which is what happened.

2 days later we hang out again, pick her up, get some food, and end up back at my place for round 2. Even better sex than before and this time we didnt use a condom (risky yes ik), and laid there afterwards talking and cuddling for an hour before i dropped her off at her place.

On the way home she again, did say some things that really made me think about things like… “If this thing we got going on turns into something more in the future…. Etc” and we laughed and i agreed that what weve been doing has been alot of fun and i even told her not to be a stranger and lets hang out again soon.

2 days later, i invite her to the beach with my 4 friends (all couples) and my brother and sister in law ended up coming. We all had a great time, i bought some drinks for everyone (i dont drink, sober 3 years) and she and my sister and law talked and laughed the entire time. 
We left together, got pizza, and both agreed were exhausted after a long 4 hours at the beach and i took her home.

3 days have passed, not much conversation at all from her. Hours of no response from text, and left me on read a handful of times. Yesterday she did ask if i wanted to go to the mall with her and then quickly retracted and said its too late and the store she wanted to go to will be closing soon (not a lie it was getting late) and said lets do it tomorrow. (Now today)

Nothing all day other than a snapchat saying she just woke up at around lunch time today. I asked her a few hours ago what shes doing tonight, and no response.

I dont know yall, i may be tripping because im starting to catch feelings for her, but the past 3 days after the beach have been alot different. She used to text / snapchat me back within minutes and now its like 6-8 hours with nothing.

She is so beautiful, so funny and the sex is out of control good. Yes im putting myself out there right after a break up really soon, but i really like this girl. Alot. 

What do you think is going on? And should i say anything or just let it go for a few days and say how i feel maybe?",0,(22f) friend distant after 7 days of hooking up / hanging out with me (23m),r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8864811,1682468325,0,1682468343,1682468344,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,15,579

 I (20F)and my Boyfriend (22M)have been together for the past 5 months it's has not been easy, Im a very outgoing person and he has a lot of problems with most things i do but it's mainly his friends commenting on my actions . So recently we got into an argument in my house and i asked him to leave and he left but afterwards when we talked it turned into him not wanting to come over without his friend mike because He hates feeling unwelcome and it works cause mike also dates my friend. The other day we all hung out together and my bf had a very bad attitude towards me and i asked if he wanted to stay he said no I said why you say it so harsh and he said i didn't say it like nothing. So towards the end of the night when they were leaving he asked if I wanted him to stay and i said No we're not doing that today and  my friend pointed it out as well his attitude was pretty sucky so me and my bf talked about it cause I didn't want to be like i was being mean and moved past the situation. Today i'm at his house all was well we were very happy and the topic  about the situation from the day when he had a bad attitude came up he revealed he was upset that he asked me if i wanted to stay and i said no were not doing that today I told him because i didn't want him uncomfortable cause he already said no and  he said ""That's why my friends say your not good enough for me and we're not going to last and be trynna to make me talk to different females because i act like i don't like him "" So i went silent i didn't say a word for 2 hrs , I texted my friend the situation and she told her bf what i said and my bf asked why i'm mad at him like he said it i said i'm not mad at you i just been feeling like i'm not doing enough or im not a good girlfriend so it's like damn im really not enough . He told me I was playing victim and being manipulative because he didn't do anything to make me feel like that and i got his friends texting him about me.

relationship_advice,"This is a little embarrassing given the age difference, but I have this internal conflict within me where I feel a certain way when I talk to this specific colleague of mine and to be honest I'm not really sure how to handle it.

I know that there are a couple red flags to begin with -mainly the age gap- and the fact that she's my colleague but I can't seem to get rid of the feeling. The fact that she's a co-worker isn't much of an issue as she works from home whereas I work from the office on most days, and we're rarely actually forced to interact for more than a couple of messages at a time. But I know that the age difference is weird and is the bigger issue, although I must state that she has in-fact not done anything specifically to 'groom' me or to make me feel this way, it has stemmed from our natural interactions throughout my time of working at my current place.

I have admitted to myself that I find her very attractive physically, and she is also the nicest person you can talk to at the office but she's just generally nice to everyone. I don't believe that she is interested in me other than for work purposes but this is where my dilemma comes in.

I'm not sure whether I should act on how I feel and perhaps try to make some small talk unrelated to work or if I should leave it and keep it strictly work related. I know that common sense would dictate the latter, but it actually is kind of difficult for me when for whatever reason she's physically in the office. And I'm also aware from her point of view, how it would look like if anything was to come from it, I think people would definitely be weirded out if they found out. Even if she rejected me that would give me some kind of closure, but given the nature of our relationship I can't just ask her straight up.

relationship_advice,"F(30) last year I found out that my partner (M 30)  of 9 years had been going on dates with a 21 F.  As far as I know nothing physical happened but this was not the first time he had done something like this behind my back. He said that it was because I had been depressed and not giving him enough attention - which was true and so we agreed to work on our relationship. 

Ever since then I find my self fantasizing at least once a day about leaving. I also feel uncomfortable being physical with him because for many years if I said no he would beg and beg until I gave in and now mentally I just see sex as a chore now. 

Anyways, today we got into a fight because I was talking about wanting to get a laser treatment on a scar on my upper lip and he freaked out and said no. He had a similar reaction last week when I talked about wanting eyelash extensions because he says i’m doing it to impress someone else. The reality is I feel shitty about myself all the time because he has multiple times been involved with messaging other women and then the incident last year with the 21 year old and I just want to feel pretty for myself. I told him that he was being controlling and he accused me of reading feminist bullshit on reddit. 🙄

In some ways he is not a bad partner, he tries to help me with my anxiety and does sweet things like filling up my car with gas and doing things for me but I feel like its just not enough at this point.

relationship_advice,"I (21 F) am in a 4 year relationship with Todd (22 M) and over the last year or so I am constantly being doubted and told I’m wrong about literally every single fucking thing. The relationship was fun and amazing for about the first 2 years of the relationship, then of course, the arguments started to come here and there, but they were no big deal at the time. For the last while, I’m always the one who’s “wrong” and I’m at the point where I literally am starting to feel like I have to video record shit just to prove to him that I wasn’t wrong. We have a 2 year old, and she has a tablet (that I monitor daily, she only gets to use it for about an hour a day) there was this app she was using earlier, that I had never seen before, but it was similar to this other one she uses but different in a way too. My boyfriend then proceeds to say “that’s the one she’s been using all week.” I said “no… this one really looks different, she uses the other one most of the time.” Then he starts to act a little pissy and raises his voice and says “no babe, she’s been using that one, I’ve watched her all damn week.” I then proceed to go to the activity center on my phone, which lets me see what all apps she has used and for how long, and that app was NEVER there until literally TODAY! I take him the PROOF, and he starts to get even more mad and just ignores me and says nothing, then eventually says “well you still didn’t have to get all mad and defensive just because of a damn app.” I told him that he was the one who raised his voice first, and he claims that he didn’t raise his voice at all. So how the hell am I supposed to get through to him when he denies that he even did anything wrong? I am literally the one who is ALWAYS wrong it freaking feels like. He really did raise his voice at me FIRST but he completely denies that he did! When he really did! Am I going to have to start recording EVERYTHING?? I feel like I ALWAYS need evidence with EVERYTHING! This is not at all the first time this has happened, this has happened A LOT! This all happened about 30 minutes ago and I’ve had the last straw. Out of the two of us, I’m the only one who is in therapy, he thinks he doesn’t need it because he didn’t have a bad childhood like how I did. What am I supposed to do about this? I really don’t want to throw a 4 year relationship away but I can’t keep living and being with someone like this who refuses to ever admit when they’re wrong! 

TL:DR- boyfriend is always right about every single thing and denies when he does something wrong, and it makes me feel like I have to start recording the things he does wrong for evidence.",0,I swear I (21 F) am literally dating a KNOW IT ALL and a gaslighter.

relationship_advice,"For starts I love my boyfriend. We’ve been together for 4 years now he’s the best boyfriend I’ve ever had. All around great guy! But he’s now obese honestly he might be morbidly obese. When I met him he was a larger guy. But he has good genes so even though he was well over 200lbs . He’s tall and had a wide frame so he never looked overweight. He honestly just looked like a really buff body builder if he wasn’t wearing anything tight. I didn’t really realize just how big he was until I saw him naked. 

We waited several months before getting intimate and by then I couldn’t care less about his size I was in love with him. He could do no wrong. Now that we’re 4 years in … I’m still in love with him but he sexual attraction is slowly fading because he’s gained well over 70 lbs since we started dating. I met him at the gym. He walked up to me said he was new in the area and wanted to make friends. And we started off as friends, I introduced him to my friends as well and then about a year later we ended up dating. 

In the first year he told me he was trying to lose weight and I believed and supported him through that. We’d go to the gym 5x a week. Keep eachother accountable etc. then by year 2 it was just me at the gym. He’d come but not as often. I’d nag him about it and he’d always promise to do better. 

Last year I started to lose attraction because sex became uncomfortable. We can’t really do missionary anymore his stomach gets in the way. He’s burnt out after a couple minutes. He honestly doesn’t have a sex drive. His semen is “too sugary” he messes up my ph balance. And I’m getting yeast infections. He’s been sugar coating how bad his health is for awhile and he’s now taking heart medication. They aren’t permanent but they most likely can be if he doesn’t get his shit together. And the crazy thing is he’s not trying to. 

I’m counting his calories, I’m forcing him to work out. And he’s constantly working over time finding ways to avoid changing or cheating doing the hard work. It’s frustrating. He’s blaming everyone for his weight but him. While I love him I can’t see myself sticking around if he gains enough weight that he can’t function. He keeps saying that won’t happen but, it’s already happening and he can’t see it. I understand he might have some eating disorder but I don’t think i could do it to myself. I’m literally watching eat himself to death. And it sounds dramatic (to him because he can still move around) but his BMI is 40.6 he can’t do a lot of things anymore. He’s getting more self conscious about himself. His mental health is suffering and idk what to do. 

I can’t save him from himself. So I’m asking random ppl for advice. Do I continue to watch him kill himself? Do I give an ultimatum ? Do continue to passively help even though it’s clearly not working? I can’t be in a relationship with someone who doesn’t love themselves enough to save their life that’s all i know. He’d do anything for me literally anything except do better for himself and it’s so sad to know. I love him enough that I’m willing to  lose him if it means he’ll lose the weight and live a healthier life. I just don’t want him to end up dead or a vegetable.

relationship_advice,"I (26f) have been dating my boyfriend (23m) for about a year and a half. I made some really bad decisions at the beginning of our relationship and let him move into my house like two months after we started dating. I had just gotten my heart broken and I think was trying to fill a hole in my heart and my new boyfriend seemed so in love with me I just let it happen. 

     Then after living together about a month things were already starting to go down hill in our relationship but one night his best friend was driving over to see us and got into a car accident and was killed less than a mile from our house. Needless to say my boyfriend took it really hard and I couldn’t break up with him then so it just kept going how it was. 

      A little more background, my boyfriend is from a horrible abusive upbringing, physical, emotional, you name it, he was in the foster care system for like 5 or 6 years I think and his parents are still unhinged meth addicts still today. 

      I’m the main breadwinner, I have a very good job that I have worked very hard for, I’ve bought 3 new cars off the lot, I have a small shitty house but it’s mine, and I have great credit. My boyfriend has not had an actual job since we’ve been together. He kinda lied when we got together about the work he was doing and then since then he’s done side work (he’s a very talented mechanic) and things here and there. He brings in decent money under the table but he only uses it to pay for his hobby’s and to take me out to dinner and things like that. I pay all the bills and pay for all the groceries. 

     We recently went in “together” and bought a truck from my dad. We are making payments and my dad was kind enough to transfer it to my name while I pay on it, but that means that I’m the one responsible for the payment and he’s not really making enough money to pay his part plus the insurance so I pay for more than 3/4 but he’s the one that drives it and if I break up with him he’ll be left without a vehicle. 

     Anytime I bring up that it’s not working he loses it. Threatens to hurt himself, tells me he has nothing, that he’ll be homeless. Screams at me that he’s a piece of shit and he ruins everything. Tells me that I’m leaving him just like everyone else in his life has. Every time I just break down and say it’s fine so it’ll stop. He used to punch holes in the walls so at least he’s stopped doing that. 

     I just don’t feel like myself anymore. I’ve gained like 50 pounds since we’ve together. I’ve stopped caring about how I dress. I don’t talk to my friends anymore. I don’t know what to do. 

      If we break up it’s going to be a huge mess, he’s got a garage full of tools at my house, he has like 4 junk cars he’s parting out and scraping. I just feel so stupid and defeated. 

    I feel like I have to say there are good things about him. He’s sweet and caring and I believe he really loves me and he’d never cheat on me. So there is positives. Does anybody have any advice on what I should do?

TLDR: my colleague hates me because I am weaker than she expected, now she is Trying to dominate me

  


Five month ago, as I m36 started in the same Departement as R (F32). At this time we were both in a long time relationship, but unhappy.

  


We were flirting always since we are colleague. But nothing more. But On one day, we had a deep talk about our past and I felt in love with R. Few weeks later, I broke up with my gf.

  


Then R and I started to try some Restaurants as friends because we are both foodie. One day, I surprised her with a Nature themed restaurant (she is gardening Fan). She liked it very much. We drank much wine there. and since her home was near, she asked me to sleep in her living room and then.. Long Story short, My little man was drunk and could not stand.

  


She messaged me the day after that she is not interested right now in a new relationship.

  


At the work, we had the talk. I told her I have no idea how to handle such a independent woman like her, which Pressured my little man. Afterwards, surprisingly, everything was fine. We worked as usual with our clients, all perfect.

  


Then, she broke up with her Bf. She told me in the same week that she now has to travel somewhere, and I half-joking said Yeah Lets go together on vacation. She agreed and said ""but as friends"". So we booked and went two weeks later. She booked a two bedroom air bnb. The first night was awesome, we were cuddling because she wanted to have me at her bed. On the next morning, we cuddled again. And my man woke up. She felt it and grapped after it and made movements. So I wanted to get further, but she then denied. My confidence Was destroyed and I was completely confused.

  


The Rest of the Trip, I was nervous, confused, disoriented, Touchy, tried once again and she denied again, saying I do not respect her Wish to go on vacation as friend. I apologized. I feel like I did everything wrong.

  


I noticed during our vacation that she is writing many messages to a guy. In the last night, she went calling some one (that guy) and came back furious. She told me that there is a guy she is dating and after they booked a hotel, He canceled because she is a strong independent woman and He cannot handle it.

  


Since we are back at work, everytime when I say something, she says things like ""no that's dumb"" in a quiet &amp; unclear voice when she disagree. When my colleagues asks about my opinion, she answers loudly like ""na He is okay with that"".

  


What confuses me additionally: sometimes, she seems to be nice as before, E. G. After my business Trip this week, she saw me, greeted me and said I am looking good today. After few hours, same game with dominance and negative comments.

  


I understand that she is disappointed how I handled during the Trip. But I cannot stand this. What can i do? Should I talk to her? Why does she do that? What can I do to save our friendship/workmate?

relationship_advice,"I (20 F) have been dating (21 M) for 2 years. We’ve had many ups and down through out our relationship but this one has me stuck. About a week ago I told him things needed to change. We weren’t spending time together, short replies, and excuses. I only see him on the weekends due to school and work. Last night Z went to celebrate a coworkers birthday and got extremely drunk. He then called me and told me he was going home. After checking his location I found he was at his ex girlfriends house. I went and confronted them. Today he told me it was just to talk because he needed someone to talk to and her story was the same. But I still consider this a huge breach of trust and cover line cheating. ( We’ve had issues with this ex in the past). Many of my friends and family are telling me to leave him but I really want to give it one more chance. I’ve given him many chances so everyone believes he won’t change but when talking with him today he cried and apologized. He told me the different ways he was going to change such as open communication, more affection, and spending more quality time together. My birthday is this weekend and we had plans but now everyone is saying I’m crazy to go over there and celebrate with him even though I want to.

relationship_advice,"My wife (F34) and I (M35) have been married for over 5 years and have 2 young kids (2 and 4). Things have been strained since the second kid arrived, mostly related to me not doing enough to help out. I've really stepped up my efforts and regularly ask if she needs help with things, but I know she still harbors a lot of resentment and has been distant for over a year. We've been going to therapy to work through things, with a big part of this related to her not showing me any intimacy, and she just says that she has nothing left to give because of the kids and that I need to wait. 

She's made passive aggressive comments over the past year which she dismisses as jokes when I call her on it - for example:

* When teaching her about a business process at my work, I role played: ""you give me…"" and she cut me off ""..an STD!""
* When a wedding comes on the TV she moans and says ""don't do it!!""
* I forgot my younger kid's teacher's name once since I don't do daycare drop off often and she said ""you're worse than Steve!"" (Steve is one of our kids friends' parents who is pretty checked out)
* I joked about sharing a dad moment with a neighbor while I was installing some solar pathway lights and she said ""its funny how he was pressure washing and you were putting light sticks in the ground""
* We were out with a couples friend of ours at Disneyland and the dad forgot his ticket outside. I left my family and walked \~30 minutes to help him get back in. THe next morning when we were all talking about this, rather than saying anything nice about me my wife said ""if that was him (referring to me) I'd leave him outside!""
* Once I hurt my foot going down a slide with our kid. Later she saw the injury (a mild blister) and I told her what happened and she said ""you WOULD get hurt doing that""

Each time I call her on this she vehemently disagrees shes putting me down or pushing me away but just telling jokes. 

Anyway, she was cheerful this morning so I was chatting with her and she started gushing about this tik tok psychiatrist who she thinks is cute (shes a therapist). She said she loved how cocky he was so I told her I was surprised since I thought she hated that, and she said yea it must be because she's getting older. Then she said she'd love to work with someone like that, but told me don't be jealous since she loves me and she wouldn't do anything. 

The part about loving his cockiness and she'd love to work with him made me jealous…if she was just admiring a cute doc I'd have no problem.

relationship_advice,"I was unsure of how to word the title! 

So for context, I (18) have been talking to Chris (18) for almost a year now, we started talking immediately the day after I graduated and have been attached ever since. Be it good morning/good night messages, supporting one another in everything and anything and just overall having the best type of bond anyone could ever have to this day. It seems like we’ve only grown closer- now I’m not the type of person who talks to people or maintains convos but he always felt like the biggest exception. He’s the embodiment of comfort to me, in every sense.

Moving on, a few months back I went through his liked posts on Twitter out of curiosity. I noticed that he’d liked a few tweets from an account with the same surname as his- at first i thought it was his but when I opened the account it was someone addressing a ‘him’ which could only mean that they were directed towards him thought the dates she mentioned didn’t add up given that he’s currently enlisted and had been away on those days. A few days passed by and the account got deleted as well. A few months down the line the same user added me and this time they had a lottt of love quotes and such + most importantly posted something with his name and several hearts along with it. I was baffled but then again didn’t say anything because he didn’t even follow the account, which eventually got deleted. Once it was up again, all those love posts were deleted and replaced with depressing ones and some religious stuff. 

Now that I checked for the account again, I found that it’s back and that he’s following it. Not to mention the fact that she has the numerical he always uses as her name and the color in his profile picture as her header and photo. There are no indications of her being in a relationship, on the contrary she always talks about how she feels heartbroken and that he got ‘bored’ of her and such. 

I don’t know if they’re related and I can’t for sure tell if it’s about him. I don’t want to assume and ruin anything especially when he’s given me every reason to trust him and has never ever refused me anything— but I don’t know what to think of this and if I should ask about it.

relationship_advice,"I love my brother. He’s a sweet guy, funny, smart, and musically talented. However, there’s also a lot that really gets him down, and a lot that I could see why it hurts his self-image. He’s pretty short (around 5’5”) for a guy, whereas all his friends are usually hovering above or right under 6ft. He is balding, and only has a high school diploma. School was just never for him although he is smart. 

I think my brother is depressed. He is constantly worried and self-conscious about his balding, and I have never heard him bring up his height until now, but my mother told me that he remarked to her that he is the smallest out of all his friends and it bothers him. He tries to go out on dates, but usually cannot get one or does not get too far. He says he is awkward and I think he psyches himself out a lot. It breaks my heart. I can’t imagine it feels better for him seeing that all his friends are in relationships, plus now he is the only sibling not in a relationship now (our older brother is married and I am now dating a great guy). 

I don’t tell people this, but I am so afraid he may take his life one day. As I said, he is musically talented, but his music has gone nowhere in the seven years since he graduated and he is usually scraping by working entry-level jobs. I think this really hurts him. As I said, he is self-conscious about his looks and has been unsuccessful in love, too. He has lots of friends but I cannot imagine being around them 24/7 is an ego boost.

I’m not sure what advice to give him to cheer him up or encourage him. I just don’t want to lose my brother, but as a college student and a girl it is hard for me to speak to his situation as I do not relate to it. I’d love any help.

relationship_advice,"My (21f) boyfriend (22m) and I have been together for 2 years. In the last couple of months I have caught him checking out other women in front of me a few times. Last week it happened and I confronted him about it, I had spent extra time getting ready to go out with him and it was overt and felt so disrespectful. I told him that I saw that and those actions make me feel secondary and insecure. He didn’t really know how to react and apologized but didn’t say much more about it. I put it aside because I wanted to have a nice night. I kept thinking about it everyday, how if he is willing to jeopardize my feelings and security to stare at a woman for 1 minute right in front of me, surely he is doing much worse when I’m not around. I kept pushing the matter, saying exactly that to him, every time he would say that he loves me and I am his everything. This weekend I told him I’m certain he is lying to me, and asked him specific questions. 

Do you talk to and flirt with other women? 
No 

Do you ever want to? 
Yes 

Do you think about cheating on me? 
Yes 

How often? 
I guess Every other week 

Anyone specifically? 
No 

Is there anything on your phone I would be upset to find? (He lied about this first and a asked a couple more times).
I have screenshotted porn 

I feel so devastated, my self image is destroyed. I know he struggles with a porn addiction and it has come up in the past, mainly with liking pictures on Instagram of women that we both know half naked and repeatedly disrespecting the boundaries I had set with that. I no longer trust him, I want to work through this, as I really do love him very much. But I don’t know how.

relationship_advice,"A little bit of a backstory here: 

We've been dating for about 1 year and some change. We started out very casual and had no label, things were going fine until I wanted something more, but I didn't think she'd be a good GF since we were just casually dating and she didnt really seem like GF material. When I say GF material, i mean that she was not affectionate, it seemed like we were just friends with benefits, were not involved in each others personal lives like friends and family. 

So after a year of dating i called it off and we did no contact. After 2 months, she calls me after she comes back from vacation and says that she wants to meet up and I say sure. 

Since then, she acted a bit differently and more affectionate and eventually I asked her to be my gf. Cool beans i guess. 

Now that she's my gf, I have certain expectations of what I want in a gf, for example i would like her to be sweet to me, say that she misses me, spontaneously give me calls or facetimes me, go out to fun things with me like the clubs and what not, and even delve into each other hobbies to get a little closer. 

Now im the type of person that has anxious attachment style, abandonment fears, and low self esteem which she already knows about. I have bad tendencies to lash out and be mean to her when I am feeling insecure and I absolutely hate it. Mostly because I know shes doing her best and im just hurting her. 

So i made the decision to leave because I dont think i can better myself. I dont even have insurance to afford therapy. This isnt the first time we fought about this but everytime i attempt to leave, she always fights for me and convinces me to stay. 

I honestly feel like I wouldnt have these insecurites if I was with someone that understood my pain and knew how to reassure me in these moments. What should I do? I know i need to better myself and get more confidence but this has been going on for the entirety of our relationship and im just so tired of the anxiety and insecurities that come with it. 

Idk if should stay and hope that eventually there will be a time where i wont feel these insecurities or do I break up and work on this myself or find someone that shares the same curse as I do. 

Has anyone dealt with this? I really need help, like mental help and stuff. idk, im just so tired of feeling this way.

I (26f) have been dating my boyfriend (23m) for about a year and a half. I made some really bad decisions at the beginning of our relationship and let him move into my house like two months after we started dating. I had just gotten my heart broken and I think was trying to fill a hole in my heart and my new boyfriend seemed so in love with me I just let it happen. 

     Then after living together about a month things were already starting to go down hill in our relationship but one night his best friend was driving over to see us and got into a car accident and was killed less than a mile from our house. Needless to say my boyfriend took it really hard and I couldn’t break up with him then so it just kept going how it was. 

      A little more background, my boyfriend is from a horrible abusive upbringing, physical, emotional, you name it, he was in the foster care system for like 5 or 6 years I think and his parents are still unhinged meth addicts still today. 

      I’m the main breadwinner, I have a very good job that I have worked very hard for, I’ve bought 3 new cars off the lot, I have a small shitty house but it’s mine, and I have great credit. My boyfriend has not had an actual job since we’ve been together. He kinda lied when we got together about the work he was doing and then since then he’s done side work (he’s a very talented mechanic) and things here and there. He brings in decent money under the table but he only uses it to pay for his hobby’s and to take me out to dinner and things like that. I pay all the bills and pay for all the groceries. 

     We recently went in “together” and bought a truck from my dad. We are making payments and my dad was kind enough to transfer it to my name while I pay on it, but that means that I’m the one responsible for the payment and he’s not really making enough money to pay his part plus the insurance so I pay for more than 3/4 but he’s the one that drives it and if I break up with him he’ll be left without a vehicle. 

     Anytime I bring up that it’s not working he loses it. Threatens to hurt himself, tells me he has nothing, that he’ll be homeless. Screams at me that he’s a piece of shit and he ruins everything. Tells me that I’m leaving him just like everyone else in his life has. Every time I just break down and say it’s fine so it’ll stop. He used to punch holes in the walls so at least he’s stopped doing that. 

     I just don’t feel like myself anymore. I’ve gained like 50 pounds since we’ve together. I’ve stopped caring about how I dress. I don’t talk to my friends anymore. I don’t know what to do. 

      If we break up it’s going to be a huge mess, he’s got a garage full of tools at my house, he has like 4 junk cars he’s parting out and scraping. I just feel so stupid and defeated. 

    I feel like I have to say there are good things about him. He’s sweet and caring and I believe he really loves me and he’d never cheat on me. So there is positives. Does anybody have any advice on what I should do?

relationship_advice,"So my last relationship, kinda just went south. I met her right after my previous relationship; an abusive relationship that I was in with a female &amp; she was the abuser. But we both had kids prior to that so we kinda knew what we both wanted but my daughters mother kept causing problems/drama between us. My daughter was ONLY a couple months old at the time when we met. She has an older daughter, just by couple years but we didn’t make our relationship official till things died down but after that, we made it official around 2019 but during the time; I was going back &amp; forth to court over my daughter, literally every month til I started having visitations than seeing my daughter more often than I was before, it went from 2 nights a week; to week to week eventually. And it was kinda the same with her situation from her baby’s father, just causing issues between her &amp; his new girlfriend, etc. they had shit going on with them as well. But after a year of our relationship, things died down in 2020.

Than I proposed to her, we got married in the court room &amp; I’ve always wanted a big wedding but we didn’t get a chance for that cause in 2021 I got diagnosed with Cancer so I got into the hospital for a month than coming back out, we lost our home cause she couldn’t pay it all; which I understood &amp; I couldn’t help either cause I couldn’t work at the moment but with the disability I was getting it wasn’t really enough to keep us afloat so we moved in with her mom/mother-in-law which I didn’t want to at first but it had to happen, which we did; it helped make things easier but I just felt like we needed our own home/privacy, with our kids so it was hard than she quit her previous job &amp; got a new one while we still lived with her mom at the time; which was close to New Years at the time but she just started changing after that; met a guy at work, started hanging out with him A LOT; which I didn’t know about but when I found out, she kept claiming: “he was just a friend” &amp; “he was just a friend.”

And from a guys standpoint on my behalf, I know how guys are like &amp; can be, I kept telling her; “that’s not it, she might see it that way but NOT THE GUY &amp; that she needed to stop hanging out with him &amp; cut him off, simple as that” but she didn’t want to listen &amp; refused too cause they worked together, etc. &amp; he was chill; whatever, just a friend to her but I didn’t believe that or see it that way than she started to bring up or throw up my past mistakes in my face over it, things that happened before we got married etc. things I said &amp; did so than I let her make her own decisions &amp; wanted to see where it went but I always kept warning her about the guy cause I know guys from my personal experience/mistakes as a man but she still wouldn’t listen to me, every time I told her that what she was doing was wrong; she would throw up my past mistakes in my face over it so than I just stopped doing that &amp; let her be, make her own decision; I was hurt tbh, that she was even choosing someone else over our relationship/marriage for this new “friend” from work &amp; we were having issues at the time, with money, work, etc. 

And to make matters worse, I didn’t know about it from her but some girl from Facebook, that she would be hanging out with the guy after work EVERY morning, that sucked &amp; hurt me bad. And when I would bring it up to her, she would just throw up my past in my face; that’s all she did. I told her, 2 wrongs don’t make a right &amp; I may have made some mistakes before we got married; during the time when my baby’s mother was causing issues between us but 3yrs later in our relationship/marriage that I haven’t done anything in our relationship cause that’s not the person I am but things I picked up from my previous relationship before her &amp; it’s not right to keep throwing things up in my face to justify what she was doing; if she didn’t want me anymore, she could have said so. But idk what she was looking for or wanted from me or the other guy, eventually she left me &amp; ended up living with him &amp; her daughter as well while we lived with her mother/mother-in-law, tbh that hurt me like hell. So I was left to live with her mom &amp; moms boyfriend for awhile, they moved out as well; which I knew it was coming eventually, which just felt like nobody had my back. I didn’t know what to tell my daughter, she’s too young to know anything so we ended up divorcing just this year, I couldn’t take it anymore; it just hurt tbh. It still hurts to this day, especially from someone who said; they love you but chooses to walk away with another person, it’s not easy to live with. Now my daughter &amp; I live together. My stepdaughter still comes to visit to have a sleepover &amp; play with my daughter, which I don’t mind tbh. It helps them keep their relationship.

She’s always been stuck in a way of viewing/seeing me from my past mistakes &amp; doesn’t want to see or recognize my change/growth. Especially from her family/friends, just from what people tell her about me &amp; I hate it when some woman are like that, it’s like no matter what you do or say; they’ll never change their mindset. She stills wants a relationship together, says she plans to make me her goal eventually when she gets out of this relationship she’s stuck in; literally stuck in, he’s a controlling, etc. &amp; I just don’t even know if I can trust her or even deal with that anymore, tbh. Life’s short too short man &amp; if she plans to come back, I don’t want any more past drama thrown in my face, etc. or how I keep always having to prove myself to her. Granted I do love her, wish things were different but if she can’t change to grow her mindset, what do I do? Even with my actions, nothing seems to prove anything to her. She constantly just brings up &amp; uses the past, even with the action she made by walking away &amp; tries to justify it, saying; “she just wanted me to change, etc.” but I believe, if you truly loved someone in a marriage/relationship, she wouldn’t have walked away &amp; broken our family, tbh.",0,Me (28) &amp; Wife(26) divorced over her choosing/walking away with someone else.,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8864554,1682465277,0,1682465290,1682465291,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,12,1171
relationship_advice,"did I ruin my life?

I'm going through a lot right now. I got evicted from my apartment in Feburary and it's been hard trying to figure out what I'm going to do. I have a boyfriend and we just had our 2nd baby...our first is only 19 months old. We stayed in a motel for a few weeks while I was still pregnant and it cost a whole lot of money. Currently we are trying to find a place of our own which is proving difficult. His career of choice is art. I have never forced him to a get a job or to do something else besides art. I was the only one working a job and it didnt pay much bc I was pregnant and couldnt work much...his job pays only on the occasion that he can complete work...I feel like I've wasted my time and my life being with him at this point though. It's hard for him to create being in a space that isnt our own. We are staying with his sister and her family at the moment. They have a 2 year old girl and shes really a bad child. Her behavior is enough to make anyone upset. She bullys my son and constantly tries telling him what to do also copies everything he does and tries to get him to misbehave and do things he shouldn't be doing getting him in trouble. I want to take my children and leave but I know that if I go to a shelter they most likely won't let me and my boyfriend be together and its killing me inside. I hate living here with them. His sister keeps asking us if we ""figured it out yet"" which we havent because our eviction is only about 2 months old and no one is accepting us also WE JUST HAD A BABY. I'm honestly the only one able to do anything about our living situation because my boyfriend chooses not to get his credentials. I'm breastfeeding and I cant even afford to buy a 2 child stroller to take my kids together with me. I'm just trying to get my newborn what she needs. I dont know what to do anymore. I cant afford food for my son since my food stamps got revoked. I think I'm going crazy and I just want to rest after giving birth but I really cant. Their daughter constantly screams....so I'm stuck having to hold my baby just so she can get some sleep. I cant sleep. My boyfriend is breaking my heart like I dont know if hes trying to help me figure this out or not. His sister doesnt even respect our personal property shes always moving around our stuff and letting her daughter jump on our bed/take my sons toys and also keeps eating our food if we arent here...which we cant afford to keep buying for them to just eat it from us....I'm tired of feeling like im a burden to people who are supposed to be my family. My boyfriend doesnt give me hope that hes doing anything to get us out of here. I feel like leaving him and taking my kids away from this place because I know for a fact that I can take care of my kids alone if I had the opportunity for get assistance like housing or cash assistance that way I dont have to work. I feel like I've ruined my life by having kids with this guy. I'm so sad that he wont provide for us while I cannot. I dont want to talk to him about anything because he makes me feel stupid for anything I might suggest. I'm starting to regret having kids...I would be fine as a homeless person if I was on my own. But I have two babies....I need help. I feel like I have no support. Is there anything I can do...I just want to care for my kids and enjoy my newborn.",0,did I (F25) ruin my life being with him?

relationship_advice,"Greetings, fellow Redditors!

I'm a 21-year-old woman and I have been dating my boyfriend, who is 23, for a little over eight months now. Recently, we had a conversation about our future together and the topic of children came up. I was thinking of two or maybe three kids, while my boyfriend wants six. Yep, six.

Now, don't get me wrong. I love my boyfriend to bits, but I'm not sure I can handle having six little humans running around. So, I turn to you, dear Reddit community, for some advice. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Should we try to compromise, or is this a dealbreaker?

Also context: He is not religious, only has one sibling who he gets along with well and has no experience with kids while I've worked with little ones for 6+ years.

I 46m have got myself in a shitty spot.

Been together with 50f girlfriend for almost 2 years. Relationship fine but was missing the deep connection and sexual exploration I’d like (like sex ok just vanilla and same every time)

Rewind 2 months and I’m home alone and load up tinder for a look, after flicking 30 minutes I realise this is stupid and delete 

Next day I have a message in my fb messenger. It’s from my best mates girlfriend from when we were 20, whom I haven’t spoken to for 10 years.

Anyway you know what will happen, we both admit we had a thing for each other back in the day and start chatting. She and I are so connected etc it’s amazing. We meet twice, even better in person 

So I break up with girlfriend, tell her all but fact that I met someone else. But she won’t be broken up with, tries and cries and convinces me to try again 

Of course I’m an arse and other woman knows all, and we continue on whilst my gf and I do too

Gf tries at first, enjoys this exploration, but then slips back to every day within a week. I try during this time too, but ultimately still feel the same

So second break up last week and i tell her all. Again she says we are good and the change I want is what she does too. But my argument is she has had 50 years to be that person and she isn’t, and I have been communicating to deaf ears on this. I don’t want to force her to be someone else to make me happy, she needs to feel that herself?

Meanwhile other person and I are great in this department but obviously who knows about all the other areas in life and if we see eye to eye (like current gf and I do)

Also current gf has stable life and future whereas other person life and emotional state could be more unstable by the looks of things, she has had rough relationships and bad choices but seems on the right track (but only recently so worry about relapse)

relationship_advice,"She's a single mom of a two year old. I got with her after the baby daddy cheated with a younger woman from work. Her baby daddy and me worked together. She and his side piece worked in a different area. My gf and the baby daddy both told me stories of him cheating before. Well now she was a done. A few months pass then I get with her. A few weeks after that. He and his side piece get fired. We started dating February 7th of this year. Some where in March she went on a date with another coworker. Said nothing happened and it wasn't cheating. Her baby daddy lost his side piece and came back to her. She broke up with me and took him back. A few days later I decided to block her on everything. We don't exactly work in the same area so I'm like I can avoid her. Shouldn't be hard welp that was a fucking joke. It seem like no matter where I went she was there in passing. She manage to get a note and I took her back. We put all that behind us and started moving forward. So I thought..i met her child. I met her family and friends. But I feel like I'm almost last on her list. Yes she's a single mom and the baby daddy isn't in the picture. No don't twist what I'm saying. Yes her daughter will always come first. I know. My mom was a single mom so I know. But she encourages the child to tell me no, and let's the child come between the us. When we see together physically. I tried to talk to her about that and it had no affect. Her child already seen me kiss and hug her mom. Plus sleep next to her. No we don't live together. I stay the night at her place from time to time.One time in the store her child was finally warming up to me and my girlfriend missed. So when I told her she said it wasn't important. I just kind of shut down for the rest of the day. We went to one of friend/family things. Since she's Latina/Hispanic she's big on family. And it was fun at first. I'm an introvert with a small circle. But as 2-3 hours became 4-5 I got bored. I really just wanted to spend time with her. Something similar happened last time I got with her at her place. But this time was different. This guy kept trying to give me a beer after I told him I don't drink. I apologize to her for being bored. That guy I just met kept harassing me with jokes. We had small argument. And when I tried to fix it she laughed in my face and rolled her eyes. This what I mean I'm always last on her list. I just want one on one quality time with her. To get to know her better, to grow with her, but every time I see her. We're always going places with her friends and family. It's never just us. I've never had deep conversation intimacy with her. And she'll try to sweet talk me with sex but she'll go straight home and to bed after we're done doing what ever she wanted. Don't think I need sex but I don't even get any form of intimacy from this woman unless I beg her for it. She told me it's healthy for a relationship to have space. I don't live with her. I don't see her every day. I don't even stay a full weekend with her. Actually since February 7th I've only stayed over at her place 3 times maybe 4. I have a cat and she's allergic so we don't stay her. She comes over sometimes after work but not always. She's demanded I buy her things at store once. I told her in my culture that's rude and she was mad at me after that. But the other two times she was successful at demanding and making me pay. I had to pick. Fight with her in public make a scene and piss her off more or just pay. I feel like she drags me around everywhere and controls sex when we have sex. But that's it. I remember arguing with her one time and she insulted me and used my autism against me. I got so  mad at her. I told her is there anything else you want to say to me? Because I've never made fun of you, looked down at you, insulted you, raised my voice to you. I apologize when I'm wrong and ask you to explain when I don't understand. I try to be as understanding and clear as possible. She even brought up the people I text and that most are girls. I immediately brought what I was texting and offered to show her but she dropped it. But when I don't like a guy(s) being to flirty with her I'm a problem. When I got with her I told everyone. I didn't hide us. I was happy. I showed everyone our couple photos. I hate taking pictures but I do for her. Now I feel like unless she compromises with me. She's always going to drag me places and tell me where to spend money. I don't know what to do. I just want time to  grow our relationship as family, me and her. Me her and her kid. But in the end we end doing whatever she wants. And when I asked her to compromise she said she wasn't going to change for anyone. That I needed to adapt to her and her life style. I'm sorry it's long and all over the place. I'm exhausted.

relationship_advice,"My ex (20 M) Matt and I (21 M) were in a situationship for 9 months. It was ridiculous because although we weren't officially dating, we acted like we were and spent all of our time together. Our relationship has always been unhealthy and toxic. He seems perfectly content with his toxicity and even laughs about it. This relationship made me aware of my toxic traits and I want to learn to not be this way.

We're bad at communicating and don't trust each other. If I didn't do something he liked, he wouldn't tell me until he'd blow up and yell at me. If he did something shitty to me, I'd do the same thing back and he wouldn't be able to handle when the roles are reversed as if he didn't initiate the bad decision (example given later). He'd want me to be honest with him and no matter how calmly and nicely I try to word something, he would perceive it as a personal attack and escalate it into a fight and constantly bring up past events that I thought were resolved. Because of his predictable reactions, I didn't tell him a lot of things in fear that I would be belittled. Even doing something as innocent as hanging out with friends would trigger something in him.

He doesn't like my friends because I'd seek their advice and opinions about our relationship. He knew this and assumed I was talking shit when I wasn't. I went to a friends birthday party and I didn't invite him because why should I? He doesn't like my ""bitchy dumb white friends"" and accuses me of ignoring him if I don't give him my undivided attention the entire time. He was mad about me going to this party and instead of telling me, he had sex with his ex.

When he told me, I was very upset and told him that it was wrong. He empathetically replied with ""we're not dating so I can fuck whoever I want"". With this logic, it was acceptable if I did the same so I hooked up with a friend, Garrett, from a program that Matt and I both go to. When he found out, we got into an argument. He said I should've cried that the person I love fucked his ex instead of hooking up with someone else. I called him out for his double standards and said ""why can you do whatever you want but expect me to stay loyal and cry?"". He said it wasn't a double standard. After a week, he realized that having sex with his ex was wrong and apologized but still defended it by saying ""we had a long history. you don't know what we went through together"" as if that makes it acceptable to betray me.

Fast forward a couple weeks, for some reason we try giving dating a shot. He goes to the program without me and sees Matt and causes a scene. He then calls me an asshole for hooking up with someone from a club we both go to. I know both are bad but which is worse? Hooking up with an ex who you had a serious relationship with or hooking up with someone that you'd both have to see on the regular?

The next time we go to this program, I was anxious that it would end badly if Matt saw Garrett. To avoid this, I text Garrett saying ""can you let me know when you leave so Matt and I can show up?"". I tell Matt that I texted Garrett about this and he gets extremely upset. He says I'm a manipulator and liar for still having his contact and going behind his back and asking Garrett instead of communicating with Matt. I now understand why it was wrong to do this but I think he overreacted because he then broke up with me and we get into another big fight. I call him out on his bullshit and I tell him that he's selfish for fucking his ex and manipulative and emotionally abusive and making me feel bad when I gave him a taste of his own medicine. He gets deranged and accuses me for lies I didn’t make and says ""I hope you die alone"", ""my ex is way better than you"", ""you're so immature"", ""you're going to get AIDS"", and then comments ""pussy"" on multiple facebook posts...

Anyways, yeah. We're still broken up but he wants to stay friends. He gave me the options to either be friends with him or to be blocked. I know I shouldn't be involved with a person like this but I'm emotionally attached and if I do cut him out, I won't know how to react when I run into him at the program or in public. I know we're both assholes, but I'd like to hear what you think. What should I do? 

Should I say ""we cant be friends because you hoped I'd die alone and publicly humiliated me on facebook and X, Y, Z""? or say ""we can be friends and hang out every now and then but you fucked up and im not your best friend anymore"". I want to leave him but I'm also scared of losing him forever. One reason I'm hesitant to cut him out is because I will see him often since we go to the same program regularly and go to the same school and study at the same places. Despite being a horrible person, he does has some good to him. Oh god, I can hear myself.

relationship_advice,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 21-year-old woman and I have been dating my boyfriend, who is 23, for a little over eight months now. Recently, we had a conversation about our future together and the topic of children came up. My boyfriend shocked me by saying that he wants to have six children, while I have always imagined myself having two or maybe three at most.

I'm feeling a bit conflicted about this and I'm not sure what to do. On the one hand, I love my boyfriend and I can see myself spending the rest of my life with him. On the other hand, I know for certain that I don't want to have more than three children.

I'm not sure how to navigate this situation and would appreciate any advice. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? Should we try to compromise, or is this a dealbreaker?

relationship_advice,"Basically our sex life is odd. We have good sex but logistics wise we're different people. I have a higher drive, put out a lot, and like foreplay &amp; non penetrative experiences. She doesn't like pursuing, does oral once a month (I give more head than a freshman figuring out a keg tap), and doesn't like getting horny unless it's going to lead to full PIV sex.

It's something I've brought up, she mentions noticing TMJ more, not likeing it, etc. I don't push, BJs for me are physical but i'd say mostly an experience/power structure pleasure. We have frequent sex otherwise. 

What bugs me is a few things... 1. this \*was\* important to me, i brought it up early in the relationship. She said she loves sucking dick. 2. she still acts when we're with friends that she sucks dick. 3. she makes jokes about it privately with me, and says how lucky she is to have always dated guys who eat pussy. 4. she's brought up all the head she's given exes, but since i'm nice - she doesn't feel the pressure to impress/satisfy me

All in all, I get bummed out sometimes. Usually i communicate my feelings v clearly but idk if that's fair to do here.

relationship_advice,"So we’ve been dating for about 6 months and right off of the bat when asking if we wanted to be sexually active together he refused to wear condoms. I was honestly okay with that because I’m allergic to most and I do agree with the “feels better” aspect of it, however I told him we both needed to get STD/STI screened before that was possible and I got on birth control ( I hate birth control but I hate the idea of pregnancy more). One of my boundaries of sex was that he couldn’t finish in me because again pregnancy scares me and for the most part that’s been respected. However, he tries to convince me to let him finish in me and has seemed annoyed at my paranoia of taking a pregnancy test every month. Most recently our issue was that I told 100% do not finish in me because  I am in my fertile window and the chances are higher for me getting pregnant, however what he does and has been doing is finishing on my butt but then *tmi incoming* rubbing his semen up and down my butt/vaginal area so it eventually gets in the area I don’t want it to be in. I’ve told him how this affects me because I’m so scared of getting pregnant and he keeps finishing in places where it drips down into the general area of where I don’t want it. I confronted him after sex asking him why he does that and all he had to say was that it was an accident, but I don’t believe it. He can not rub it all around and aim for a place where there’s no chance of dripping.

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) have been dating for about a year. From the very beginning, even before we started officially dating, I made it clear that I do not want to be with someone who keeps in touch with his exes. I don’t interact with any of mine, and I just don’t understand it. I get that people stay friends with exes and that’s fine, just not for me. He said he still has all of them on social media but that they haven’t interacted at all since the breakup, so I was okay with it. 

I never went through his phone or anything but I saw a particular girl pop up here and there on his instagram DMs and Send To list. I asked a couple of times if any of his exes has messaged him since we got together because I had a gut feeling that that girl was his most recent ex. He said no, but a couple of months later it turned out, I was right. 

When I called him out on it, he deleted his messages with her on the spot and blocked her on instagram. He explained that she had been sending him memes and he liked them here and there but that they didn’t talk. He lied to me because he didn’t want me to get angry and walk away. 

He still has his other exes on instagram and that particular ex on other social media platforms. She’s also still kind of around his social group and they have mutuals even though they don’t interact directly with each other. I keep thinking about how he lied and it still deeply bothers me, and my stomach turns. 

I decided to forgive him and move on from this and it’s already been 6 months since it happened. But I still can’t help but break down every once in a while and it really hurts and I wish he handled the situation better and with more sense of urgency. I don’t think he understands that I thought of breaking up with him because of this. 

I really think he fucked up big time but he’s been good about listening to me whenever I get anxious and giving me reassurance. He loves me a lot and I love him a lot, and I see a future with him but I don’t know what he can do or I can do to be able to move past this.",0,I’m (25F) still hurt that my boyfriend (30M) was in touch with his ex behind my back and lied about it until I confronted him,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8864415,1682463979,0,1682463992,1682463993,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,25,412

I love him very much because he treats me well as-long as i don’t bring up problems. As soon as i try to bring up any issues I’m having with the relationship he goes off on how he’s a terrible boyfriend and how he should of never been born. i’ve tried to comfort him when he gets like this but at this point i get too frustrated with him to help. 

Another thing with him is he’s very pushy when it comes to sex. i don’t have a high sex drive but he does and always tries to get me to have sex with him even if I don’t feel like it. Because if I tell him I’m not in the mood to have sex, he takes it as it’s his job to try to turn me on and it gets frustrating really quickly. It’s also scary too because he is much stronger than I am. He works out a lot and I stay inside all day.

My girlfriend got news a week ago that her ex had died in an accident, she has told me before that there aren’t any feelings there anymore and that it’s done. Before dating they were in the same friend group but haven’t spoke since it ended. But with everything that’s gone on (funeral, her thinking about their good moments when we are together) I can’t help but think that what she said is bullshit. I’m trying to support her through it but i feel neglected and kind of like the guy on the side. We’re really young and it’s my first time dealing with anything like this. Today was the funeral and so she was obviously upset, when I told her that I wasn’t feeling great either she didn’t even seem to care. 
How do I deal with this ?

relationship_advice,"Trigger Warning SH

On Saturday I showed my boyfriend a picture of me and my best friend back when we were both 14/15, I joked that that's when I would dress Emo since I had that phase in middle school. He looked closely at the picture and then just stiffled a laugh. I asked him why he laughed and he joked ""I just wanted to see if you had any cuts on your arm or something"". 

I felt really uncomfortable since I had never talked about this with him, but even before I would dress like that I did have a tendency to self harm. I haven't done it in  around 5 years or so. I just looked at him and told him that he was being rude, and he just looked and me and told me that people who do that are plain out stupid. 

I understand doing something like that is stupid but I've currently almost relapsed in the past few months. Hearing it from him just made me feel more ashamed and embarrassed about it. He noticed I got upset at his comment and asked me if I used to do that. I explained that It doesn't matter if I did or not since that's in the past but what he said was very hurtful and rude, he apologized and hugged me for a while and eventually continued what he was doing.

For the rest of the day I just kept to myself and was a bit distant with him, eventually I just let it go but I kind of feel like I need to discuss this more with him so he understands where I'm coming from, especially since I've considered doing it recently whenever I would feel extremely upset and overwhelmed. I usually zone out and isolate myself for less than 30 minutes to calm down, but that hasn't been helping recently.

I'm considering either letting this go or talk to him about it, right now we're doing good but I find myself covering up since I don't want him to look for any faded scars.

relationship_advice,"So my good friend from college (F30) that I (M32) used to hang out with and study a lot with during my college years have started reaching out a lot more lately. More than what we normally have ever done I think. She just recently came out of a very deteriorating relationship with her ex bf that had turned into an abusive one and she was of course devastated and hurt but she managed to leave him and now she's working on recovering.

She started reaching out a while ago when they were still together. We usually never hang out this much but I can tell that she's enjoying my company a lot and only sees me as a friend. 

The problem here of course is that I don't. I have never really only seen her as a friend but always been low-key interested in her. I always suspected that she wasn't interested in me that way (which is why I never made a move) but now I feel more sure about it after a few deep conversations we had about our lives. 

I know she needs people like me to be able to recover and get her mind off all the bad shit in her life. And I've tried my best to always be there for her. But the thing is that I'm struggling too with lonliness, low self-esteem, depression, etc. And it just hurts a whole lot and starts to take a toll on me to be close to her as often as I've been. I've been single for a long time and being poked with and dragged around with like this makes me feel so miserable.

I don't know how to tell her this and how to make her know that she's hurting me. I don't know how to tell her to keep her distance without completely destroying our friendship. Because I honestly do value our friendship. Just not as intense as it's starting to become now. I don't even know if I should admit to her that I've been low-key interested in her all these years. It's all becoming very unbearable for me and I find myself more depressed and feeling this heavy weight in my chest that I can't get rid of.

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend (M29) and I (F23) have been together for about 3 years and living together for 2 years. 

I found out he was sexting other girls on Instagram through his 2nd account (I know about this account). He sometimes streams online and has a 2nd old phone he uses for it. One day, he left to go on a trip and I saw a weird message on the phone from a girl who is also a streamer.

He has told me his password before so I went through his instagram messages. It was pretty bad. Turns out it was 2 girls who were also streamers. You can’t reopen sent photos on IG but I can tell they were nudes from the comments my bf sent back. He was even talking about sex stuff like what he likes and what he does in the bedroom. When one of the girls asked if he had a partner, he said no. He asked for their snapchats. I presume the sexting continued there.

This started about a year ago, May 2022, and while living together. It is now April 2023. 

I confronted him the second he got home. However, I did not tell him what I knew. I gave him a chance to be honest with me and come clean. He then admitted something different, an ex texted him and they had a conversation. He sent his thigh tattoo pics to her. After all that, he THEN told her he has a girlfriend. He said nothing bad happened. I never saw the texts so I only have his word. 

After I told him that’s not it. He continued to be clueless. I gave him a hint that it was streaming related and he then said the girls name. His face dropped. He said they weren’t being inappropriate and only talked about their shared interest with streaming. After lying to me. I then told him everything I knew. 

He proceeded to say his sorry’s and that it happened once and he was disgusted by it. He lied again. This did not happen once and it was more than 1 girl. I asked to look through his personal. He said he has been in my position before and if I look through phones, it will be hard to repair the trust. I told him idk if I could ever trust him again. He never gave me his phone.

This is when he started pleading and begging to me for forgiveness. Saying he did it because of his deep-rooted insecurities. That he hated how everyone would ask him “how’d you get her” when referring to me being in a relationship with him. That it was his fault and he has problems to work through. 

I kicked him out that night. He said he might hurt himself. It broke me but I still sent him to his moms. His mom and sister come over the next day. They both have been through this situation before with men. They said they would support me with whatever I decide. I can tell they want me to forgive him. I can tell they will be  understanding if I don’t.

I thought I was set on my decision to leave the relationship. It is only day two, and I am having conflicting thoughts and feelings. He tells me he wants to work on himself and go to therapy. That he cannot stand himself for hurting me and will do everything he can to fix this. Basically, he promises to change and do whatever he can to regain my trust. 

I’m not sure to believe him or not. I told him once that wall of trust fell apart, I realized other issues in our relationship. Financial, Sex, and Family issues all stemming from him not willing to make sacrifices. He has admitted to all of these issues and promises to deliver change.

I still love him and I know he loves me. I want the best for him either way. He was my boyfriend and my best friend, I feel so betrayed. I am afraid of losing the life I had with him and losing him. I am afraid of this happening again and my time being wasted.

relationship_advice,"Me and my boyfriend met through our friends on discord. We started playing all day every day, to the point we got super close. We started calling just outside of playing games and we both developed feelings. He would always stay on call with me if i had trouble sleeping, till I fell asleep. This became a habit, and he would basically tuck me to sleep every night. We wanted to expand our relationship and therefore planned our first meeting. It has now been 8 months since we first met up. In between then and now, we met up 3 more times. I’m also gonna visit him again in 3 weeks. 

We used to play mostly Valorant. However, a couple of years before meeting me, my boyfriend played MMO’s before switching to FPS. So when I saw that a new MMO, Lost Ark, was releasing, I was thrilled for him. He did not seem that interested in Lost Ark. However, I said I would love to try it out with him if he wants to, and he agreed. Although, I quickly found out how much grinding you’re supposed to do in an MMO, so I did not play too much. My boyfriend however, got hooked. He started playing without me and advancing further, basically making it quite impossible for us to play together. I gave up on it as I didn’t rly like the game nor did I like playing it alone. 

I did not mind it that much as it seemed like he was having fun. 
The problem is, that he got completely addicted. We no longer hang out over call everyday, we don’t play games every day, he won’t tuck me to sleep everyday anymore and he sometimes replies really late. I’ve started feeling very lonely. He has a big friendgroup in Lost Ark and plays it like religiously 8 hours aday if not more. Even when we do call, we do not get a very valuable conversation because of him being focused on the game. He often dismisses my attempts for us to call because he feels drained after being in call with friends for so long. 

I’ve started showing annoyance and sadness, I’ve told him about feeling lonely and missing him alot. Everytime, I get vulnerable and sad with him about this topic, he apologizes and promises to spend more time with me. But nothing has changed, after months and months. He often says he is chosing me above his friends because of him leaving his friends to join my calls. This really hurts me, as I would love for him to just be excited that I’m calling, as I’ve been eager to talk to him myself, without making me feel bad that he has to leave friends for me. 

I’m feeling very lost on what to do. I love him very much but I feel like I’m just grieving and trying to hold on to how our relationship used to be. I’ve only felt this way this strongly for about a month, and I’ve cried multiple times to him, about how I’m feeling. It seems like nothing is changing. 

What can I do? Am I the issue? Or are we both maybe seeking something else in a relationship? Anyone got any advice for me?

relationship_advice,"Hi everyone! Let me just say this from the beginning, English isn’t my motherlanguage, so if there are mistakes, I’m sorry in advance.

So my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years now. We are sort of long distance. We don’t live close to each other, but we don’t have to take a plane or anything, it is just hard to see each other more than every 3 weeks. He has a job, and I’m still a student. So we are in different places in life right now. The issue is that I have the feeling that I’m more of a burdon to him than something he really wants. Maybe that’s pushing it a bit, but a don’t know how to say it otherwise. 
I really love being with him, it always makes me sooooo happy. I just love him so much that just seeing or hearing him for 2 seconds can make my week. We mostly chat during the day on Snapchat. But calling or meeting is difficult. When I tell him that I miss him, he tells me he misses me too and stuff. But the thing is that I miss him a lot, so when I say that every couple hours he can get sad, which I get. But we can’t change our situation right now. It’s just that he tells me that all the calling and meeting we do is to make me happy, that it’s difficult for him to always have the energy for it. That just feels like it doesn’t make him happy. He is an introvert, I am too untill I really care about someone and then I become an extravert. So I get that I can cost a lot of energy sometimes, I mean I really want a lot of attention when I can be with him. When I tell him that I also wanna do things to make him happy, he doesn’t tell me what would make him happy. He says he doesn’t know either. So that makes me a little bit frustrated because I wanna be a part in his life that makes him happy. I just don’t have any idea how to do that without always telling him that I love him.

Do you guys have any advice for me?

relationship_advice,"
I am 20, and my boyfriend/ex is 21. We have been dating for over a year (18 months about) and this has been such an amazing relationship for me. We started off great with minimal issues up to this point-or at least that’s what I thought. I recently found text messages between him and his ex girlfriend that were EXTREMELY flirty, I wasnt going to invade his privacy like that initially (we are pretty casual about that stuff anyways) but I had noticed while talking to people around me he would avoid answering her. I always thought I was a little crazy for worrying about her since the reason we first became so close was because he helped me through my break up prior, after I was emotionally cheated on. He related to me as this specific girl had also cheated on him (they dated while in high school and up to the beginning of college) and kinda led him on for a bit after. I never would have expected something like this from him at all. I even brought up how I trusted him to have clear boundaries with her whenever i felt I was being too paranoid. I never had a good feeling about her, but I always figured it was just a problem on my end with trusting people after already being cheated on. After finding these texts I confronted him about it. There was an initial shock as he told me there was no intention of cheating, and that he had no idea why he did it, and that it wasnt an emotional affair or anything, and that he knew he was never going to see her again so it didnt seem so serious to him.  I left his house shortly after that. After talking a little with my friend who had a similar experience, I reached back out to him for more information about this and to let him know anything i couldn’t say when speaking to him in person.  I learned that he had been on and off flirting with her (in a pretty sexual manner, almost sexting territory, and just overall so disrespectful to me) since last summer. That was when we were together, we have been long distance since i took a LOA in the fall for mental health reasons (completely separate issue). It hurts so much to know that he was talking to her the same exact way he would talk to me in a situation like that, whether he meant anything by it or not. I knew he was bad at boundaries and I have reason to believe she initiated some of the advances, but I know that he is truly the only one to blame for replying to them like he did. Normally I would just leave the person in this situation but im pretty stuck in my decision because this could have been a lot worse, and he genuinely seems to regret it and is willing to change if i ever decide to consider moving on from this with him. But i feel so guilty for entertaining the idea of staying with someone who might just hurt me in the same way again. Our relationship seemed absolutely perfect, and I dont know what possibly drove him away enough to do that. I worked really hard on maintaining good boundaries, healthy communication and fun in our relationship up to this point. Sure, the distance has been hard, but he told me this has been happening since we were in school together (for the summer). He claims that the friendship was so convoluted and confusing to him and that talking to her about this stuff was a mistake, but at the time it almost felt fake, as if he were talking to some porn bot, i guess. I have been trying to ask him more about this and see if there’s anyway it was somehow something more but he has only explained himself using this reasoning. This issue is so fresh and I’ve decided to not talk to him for some time, as I had been being pretty nasty after thinking about what happened and how he broke my trust over and over again like this. But i really dont think this should be a deal breaker, as much as it hurts. He is one of my closest friends, and we have done so much together. I love him more than anything and he has made me feel things I’ve never felt with anyone before. We have the exact same humor and I was just so happy with him. I felt like we were growing into better people together. He was the last person i expected to lie about something like this. I know he’s not evil and he’s extremely remorseful about this, but I am so worried that if i try to work through this and consider taking him back in the future, it’ll just be worse. Would it be stupid to consider trying again? I understand that Im young, and that this issue might not seem so serious to some, but this relationship was truly something I planned to bring into the future with me. I don’t want to just leave him after something like this, and he has agreed to get professional help with whatever issue this has to do with. I know it will not go back to the same as before. But the last thing I want is to walk away from him forever, it just hurts so much knowing this happened as I trusted him so much and found comfort in that trust. I just dont know what to do and my solution to any type of cheating has always been to just dump them and go, but this seems so different and I feel that we are still capable of getting through this. Has anyone had a similar experience? Is it stupid to consider not leaving him? I just dont know where to go from here…I feel pathetic for wanting to work through it as I have always thought people who take cheaters back are dumb. But im starting to partly understand why people put themselves in risky situations for people they truly love like this.

relationship_advice,"I’ve been seeing this guy for a month. He’s every thing I like in a guy. We get along, we vibe, we have almost everything in common. He’s funny, sweet, charming. We both love old movies. We always end up falling asleep together... we cuddle a lot. He likes running his fingers across my body. Last time I was on his bed watching tv and he got up to put his dogs out and I caught him staring at me smiling..  

I can definitely say I really really like….. in just a short time of knowing each other… more than I’ve liked any guy I’ve ever even dated.. but I’m somewhat scared of commitment… I took a couple years of being single and working on myself. I’m now in a way better financially independent and mental state that I do not want to ever ruin that or go back to what it was before when I found out my ex cheated on me our entire relationship… 
 I found out because he cheated on his gf at the time with me and she found out and spilled everything…

I did not know he was still seeing her, he said they broke up and he was always in love with me… all lies.. anyway… she pretty much snitched on him. Told me everything, like he wished I committed suicide… they apparently would constantly joke around about wanting me to die… I think that stuck to me because even after everything he’s put me through even after we broke up I had dreams about him dying and would wake up crying… although I did not want to be with him at all I still cared for him as a person…

Anyway… this guy I’ve been seeing he recently started calling me “baby” and “babe”… I thought maybe he was trying to hint he wanted to start something but I also I’m so out of todays idea of “dating” and also think maybe he’s just calling me that because he wants to… nothing about it…

But today we were talking about abusive men (odd topic) but it was brought up during text… and he responded “im serious. I like you, I’d beat up someone for you”…


Was that his way of trying to move what he have forward? I honestly responded “Hahha you’re too cute” and he hasn’t responded to it for the day….",0,Was he (36M) trying to confess that he likes me(30F)?,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8864241,1682462371,0,1682462382,1682462382,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,10,400

relationship_advice,"I am the youngest of 5. I have 2 older brothers and 2 older sisters ranging in ages from 36 to 30. The 3 oldest siblings all have kids around the same ages. One of my sisters (33f) in particular has 4 kids. Her second oldest kid is now 8 or 9 and when he was much younger he started wanting to identify as a boy (he was born a girl, ftm). 

At first they thought maybe it was just a phase since he was very young, but as he grew older he was just so depressed being a girl. So they let him cut his hair and change his name/clothes. It’s been this way for 4-5 years and nothings changed. 

Before this, all of the kids were super close and there were no problems. But now, my oldest brother (34m) has refused to let his kids see my sisters kids due to religious reasons. He said “I won’t let my kids be exposed to something unnatural like that”.  This has caused a divide in the family. 

Because of other family issues, I’m the only sibling that all of my siblings care to speak to (if that makes sense). My sisters don’t speak to each other, my brother doesn’t like my other brother or the one sister… it’s a mess. So I’m like the neutral sibling that everyone cares about. 

Even though I try to get along with all my siblings, I feel like I’m betraying my nephew and my sister by staying in contact with someone who could be so nasty to family.

She says all her patience she needs for me, baby and dogs is run out because of work and her students. However, I want to clarify that she doesn't take stress out on our baby or dogs.

Hey guys. A little over 6 months ago I went through a breakup and shortly thereafter met a girl who I really got along with. We went on a couple of dates and had some cuddles and kisses, but both ultimately decided we weren’t ready for anything serious and decided to just be friends for the time being. She wasn’t ready because she was very busy with school and work and had never really been in a real relationship, and I wasn’t ready because my breakup was still fresh and I needed to work through some feelings.

After that conversation, we’ve hung out as friends and it's been really fun. I’ll admit my feelings toward her haven’t wavered and while I love having her as a friend, I’ve always wished we could be in a relationship together. We once recently marathoned a series together for 12 hours and I had to resist the urge to “make a move” to put my arm around her out of fear of damaging our friendship.

I feel like she still may have feelings for me but I can’t tell for certain. I’m afraid to bring it up because I really value our friendship, but at the same time, I really think we would work well as a couple. It's been 6.5 months since we decided to just be friends. Is it a good idea to ask her how she feels about us? Or should I wait for her to make a move?

relationship_advice,"[short version] It's been 6 months since when me and my ex broke up. Since then, she came back into my life 4 times and that is holding me back.

Back in october we broke up because she lost feelings, and we stopped talking for around 3 weeks, when we talked about taking back the stuff and tried again to talk sometimes.
But then suddently she felt like it was going bad and wanted us to stop talking arouns the start of december.
Then we talked a bunch of times and i told her i wanted to end things forever and not keep contact about at the end of december.

She wrote to me again at the start of february, writing to me almost everyday with some excuse, but then she stopped writing to me at all. At the start of march she told me she was ready to go ahead and she wanted me out of her life, so i stopped following her and never wrote to her again.

Around 10 days ago, her cat ran away and she wrote to me, so i went helping her search it. She didnt look that desperate(im sure the cat ran away because her dad was searching with us) and talked about everything while we spent 2 hours togheter. Then we chatted a bit and when the cat came back i didnt reply.
Since then we met 2 times and she act like an old friend.

The bad thing is that everytime she wrote to me again she had to say that she didnt see anybody else and that made me do the same thing and that somehow made me stuck on her, because i cant stop thinking about her.

At the same time, i dont want to try to get back with her because i know i dont love her anymore.

Im trying to focus on myself but even keeping my mind full i still think about her too much and everytime im about to stop thinking about her she just writes to me again and starts the circle again.",0,"The carrot and the stick 19F,21M",r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8864127,1682461262,0,1682461280,1682461280,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,6,349

relationship_advice,"TLDR: I might be the other woman and idk what to do...HELP

I (31f) have a BF (29m) and we have been together for almost a year. He has always been a very busy guy which has limited our time together which I never thought too much of until last night.

Last night he sent me a selfie of a new tattoo he was in the process of getting and I noticed a ring. I've never seen this ring in any other picture and he has no ring tan line.
But when I saw that picture my heart sank. I had a million thoughts and scenarios racing through my mind. I tried to be reasonable and maybe it was on his right hand instead of left but he is heavily tattooed and I know which side they are on, and the ring was definitely on the left hand.

When I asked him about the ring, he said that his tattoo artist and him made a bet that I freak out (my text seemed calm but trust me I was losing my mind). I started asking questions like where the artists shop was and he told me it was about 45 minutes away. When I looked at the location of the picture it was about pinged about 5 minutes away. I asked him and he said that his geolocation was wrong. That seems a little suspicious it to be that incorrect.
This may seem silly, but now I'm questioning everything about the last year together. His excuses for bailing on date night, never wanting to run in to people he knows, I have only met 1 friend of his, I've never been to his house, sometimes (most weekends) I don't hear from him.

Around the holidays his phone quit working for like 4 days. Could his phone have actually quit working, possibly. Or was he spending time with his hypothetical family (meaning his wife/significant other), seems more likely now.
When we are together, he's constantly checking his phone, phone is always facing down, and when he checks his phone he keeps it really close to his face. We have only had 2 sleepovers and he came over really late at night and left about 5:00 a.m. He's never given me a reason to be distrustful but the picture I got yesterday has awoken the over-thinker in me.

relationship_advice," **TLDR: Broke up with ex 6 months ago due to distance. Now she lives in my neighbourhood. Am I right to feel upset by this?**

Dated a girl last year for 10 months. She was so kind, sweet, loving, and maybe the best girl Ive ever dated.

One of the two reasons why I ended up breaking up with her was the distance. I live right in the city in a young, fun part of town whereas she lived in the suburbs 75 minutes away by transit. Needless to say it wasnt always fun trying to plan things with her. Most of the time she would usually spend weekends at my place because her friends were in the city, her work was in the city, and all the exciting date ideas were in the city.

This became a bit of a problem as I am super busy person with my work, and I have a lot of hobbies including Latin Dancing and Muay Thai as to both I am at a very high level with and I take seriously.

In relationships you will always make compromises so a thought I had was for her to join me! We met through the latin dance scene so I always invited her to join my classes and in her hometown she used to train Muay Thai so I invited her to that as well. But due to distance it was sort of pointless for her to join my studios and gyms.

The other reason I broke it off is it never felt like she initiated and took action in most things. Out of 100 dates - I planned 95 whereas she planned 5. The relationship started to feel like a bit of a job and it became a bit exhausting...

Needless to say I started to put my hobbies in front of her and in the final weeks of the relationship things started to go sour. I knew that I was beginning to retreat and not being the affectionate boyfriend I once was. I felt I wasn't giving her the love she deserved and that it was best she maybe find someone else that can give that to her so I don't waste her time anymore. I thought I was doing something honorable even though breaking up with someone is never pleasant. After it ended I even texted saying that if she ever needed anything Im always there to help (obviously at her own discretion).

Fast forward to 3 nights ago and I run into after 6 months of no contact. As soon as I saw her my heart sunk and my feelings returned. Its interesting how being the dumper you think youre indifferent to them but this was not the case.

I tried to be as friendly as I could be and had a conversation with. I asked her about her life, her family, her friends, and if she finally moved out of her old neighborhood. She seemed to rub her life in my face a bit which I found quite rude and told me she now lives in an area 15 minutes walk from my house...

This really upset me and felt like a major punch to my gut. We parted ways and I felt awful. I did text her yesterday saying ""It was great seeing you, Im happy your life is going great etc"" and she replied ""Thanks, yes everything is awesome and Im glad I moved to XXX"". I asked if she is ever free for a coffee or a drink to let me know and we can catch up but unfortunately she replied that she is seeing someone and would like to respect that. This was totally understandable, I acknowledged it and said take care.

I know in this situation I am the dumper who automatically gets labelled the Bad Guy. And some will say ""Boo hoo this is Karma"" I know the mistakes I made in the past and I hope she is able to recognize she isnt perfect either.

But am I right to feel a bit hurt that now she lives in my neighborhood?

relationship_advice,"Me and my current gf have been together for almost 2 years now. For the first year and a half everything was going great, we hung out, had great conversations and overall seemed pretty good. But around 6 months ago everything started to change. She doesn’t seem to want to do anything anymore besides text and she barely texts me. She never gives solid answers to whether or not we can hang out or always has an excuse to stay home. I’ve always tried to be understanding and look past it, but since she’s started to not respond for hours on top of not wanting to hangout it ,I’ve started to feel unloved. And recently she’s been hanging out with her friends a lot, which I was okay because she’s had mother issues when it comes to leaving the house. But she’s always hanging out with them but seems to never make time for me. I told her I felt like there was a disconnect and I felt unloved. She apologized and said she’d do better. Then a week later said she wanted a break and felt like I had been making less of her mental struggles. We ended up talking it out and worked on boundaries for her to have alone time. Which I’m not certain of because it’s not like we spent time together in the first place. I really love this girl, and if im overthinking it I will happily accept that.

relationship_advice,"My bf (31m) and I (29f) have been together for over 3 years and we’ve been doing long distance the whole time because he’s in the forces.

We love each other and have great fun when we’re together (approx every other weekend plus some holidays).

Recently though, the long distance has started to take its toll because he’s not great at verbal communication. 

When we are physically together I generally feel well loved. But when we are apart and relying on texting and phone calls, I struggle to get the emotional depth from him that I crave. 

He often says he “doesn’t know what to say” in emotional situations - eg. anything from death of a grandparent right through to me getting some success at work. 

I feel like I have to spell out what I need from him every time which makes me feel a) partly like his mother and b) like some sort of needy girlfriend which I genuinely don’t think I am nor want to be. I just desperately need a human level of emotion about some things.

I feel bad raising it again because I know he struggles with that stuff and I really believe it’s not a reflection of him not loving me, because I’m sure he does. It just feels like we are on different emotional playing fields and I have to be quite emotionally resilient and trust that he does love me when we are separated geographically. I’m terrified that it might break us up if we can’t find a solution.

relationship_advice,"A bit of background: We're long distance. We've been thorough hard times ever since she broke up with me last year (we've been together for 5 years), I took it very hard and got very distant after we reconciled. I was a shitty boyfriend and stopped  looking for time with her due to resentment for what had happened. Some time passed and we had really intense and heavy conversations about my shitty behavior during those months after we reconciled, and I apologized profusely, and continue to do so. I've shown her and proved to her that I will never be the person I was during those months, but her trust in me hasn't been the same since.

Now on to the current hardship. I recently got a second job (my first job is very relaxed and hours are very flexible, on top of it being from home) that demands most of my time during weekdays, this has become a problem because the only quality time we spend together is during my hour-and-a-half long public transport commute when I call her to ask about her day and tell her about mine. She feels like this is not enough time together, and feels frustrated that the days on the weekend when she's free are the days in which I am not. I tell her I'm okay, because the little time we do spend together is very valuable to me, but she's starting to resent me because of it, saying it's not fair that this affects her more than me. Yesterday I think she went through her breaking point, saying she doesn't feel happy anymore and is not even sure if she feels in love anymore, which she followed by saying that I should break up with her, and if I really cared for her, I would leave her.

I really don't want to break up with her because she truly makes me happy, I feel like butterfly raves happen inside me every time I even hear her voice. Iv'e told her how I feel about this and how the decision should be her's if she genuinely feels unhappy in this relationship, and if she feels us breaking up is the best for her wellbeing, I understand, but I would not make that decision for her.

I'm at a total loss right now, I have no idea what to do, because I do fucking love her to bits. I only want her to be happy and if that's not with me I understand, but I don't want to make that decision, and even less when she's not even sure that's what she really truly wants.",0,My girlfriend (F23) is almost begging me (M22) to break up with her,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8864046,1682460386,0,1682460402,1682460403,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,13,442

relationship_advice,"I’ve been seeing this girl since around December. We met last August but were friends until we decided to sleep together. We became FWB and decided to go exclusive March of this year. 

Since then, I feel like we’ve gotten closer, but the problem is, she might be moving away around June-July time, and I have zero clue what’s gonna happen after that. We spoke a while back that the agreement would be that we’d probably just go back to being friends after June, but we have certainly gotten closer since then. 

But I also don’t know whether I’m catching feelings too hard here; I feel like this girl is on my mind all the time, and I’m really not too sure how she feels of me. She doesn’t like to have serious talks (when we brought up the exclusive situation, she said ‘okay no more serious talks now’) after that. I kinda just feel like it’s hard to communicate with her. One of my friends thinks she has the ‘avoidant personality’ type, but I’m not sure. On the other hand, she shows a lot of affection when I’m with her, often wanting to kiss and cuddle all the time. She’ll also notify me when I’m doing something that bothers her, sort of how you would in a relationship. We also do couple like things, like going to the shower together and stuff. 

I also find it somewhat hard to trust her. Whilst in the FWB situation, she slept with 2 guys. This is fine as we weren’t exclusive at the time, but she’s also told me she can be ‘impulsive’, which I don’t understand how to interpret. It feels like at any moment, she’ll turn around and tell me she’s ‘cheated’ (I guess it would be cheating if we agreed to go exclusive).

relationship_advice,"Look we’re in a complex situation and a lot of things are complicated/ don’t make sense so please ask any questions to clarify if any reads this/ cares.
So my “boyfriend” and I are both at uni. I am slightly ADHD he is most definitely Asperger’s(which yes I know is now ASD). Our first year of uni was idealistic and we saw each other a lot despite being in different cities and are very similar, well suited personality wise and we’ve had decent intimacy. Neither of us have a high sex drive which is something i appreciate after having a past abusive relationship.

Recently he has felt incredibly stressed and overwhelmed with general life and has entirely struggled since the start of 2023 once second term started. Before things felt normal and good in our relationship with no real issues, in fact we started to get a greater understanding into each other. 

Things have been tough this year and he had struggled for the first time in his life with depression and just an overall hard time whereas I have dealt with shit so I have a more optimistic “things will be better” idealistic view of the future whereas he has a wholly pessimistic view. For instance our intimacy has been low, I understand he is depressed so has a low libido and we’ve not seen each other regularly to have sex so I’m not too fussed, however he is now overthinking this and is anxious to whether he is attracted to me and has tried to logically explain why when there’s no real reason. We are still attracted to each other but the situation hasn’t been the same and I don’t place expectations on him. 

After a particular awful day he decided we should have a break or just be friends for the time without a any real timeline of how long this will last. We have both been devastated by this. He basically a wants everything to remain exactly the same regarding texting and communication but not officially be together. I know this does just sound like he’s messing me around but with his ASD a lot of this is what i would call stress relief/ damage control. He doesn’t know how else to deal with his depression so is trying to solve it by managing the situations he can control.

He made it clear he didn’t want to lose me and is very much still in love with me and can’t bear the thought of being without me. However this is not fair on me if there is no promise of exclusivity or us getting back together. He seeing know what will happen in the future but u am willing to wait and fix things for a certain amount of time. 

I just don’t know what to do. We are each other’s best friends and there is a lot of love there but I don’t know how long I can deal with this relationship purgatory he’s put us in

relationship_advice,"*TLDR: I'm hard on myself and want to improve in various aspects of my life (Health, fitness, relationships, career, finances, etc). If I want my partner to strive to reach his potential and he's not, are we incompatible or do I have unreasonable expectations for what I want in a partner?*

Any help/advice here is really appreciated and thank you in advance for reading this. I'm a 25 y/o male. My partner (27M) and I have been dating for just over 6 months. I've been engrossed in stoic readings the past few years, and have been working to transform my life/thinking/actions to align with stoic teachings. It's given me so much peace and is truly a philosophy I consider to be embedded in the fabric of who I am and who I want to become. I'm working to optimize my life in a way that neither my health, career, nor my relationships (romantic and platonic) are neglected. It's hard work and I often fail to balance them, but I'm trying.

I just finished ""Discipline is Destiny"" by Ryan Holiday, and a certain quote by the famous stoic, Marcus Aurelius, stuck out to me - *""Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.""* I've been pushing my partner for months to eat healthier meals with me rather than repeatedly ordering UberEats, to go to the gym, and to have time away from his phone for self reflection. He's only recently begun making an effort to eat healthier and I'm proud of him for it, but he's not making a significant effort in other areas that are important to me. While I'm reading and trying to learn more about myself, he'll watch mindless Youtube videos and smoke weed. It drives me crazy, but I understand we have different interests. I do want to clarify that he doesn't just sit on the couch all day. He lost his dad 7 months ago and initially battled depression (which is of course expected), but he's been very successful in his career the past few years, and has done well. I've supported him as he grieves his dad for over half a year and I'm so glad he's been healing. It's definitely taken a toll on me though as I put many of my goals on pause to be there for him.

My partner recently communicated that he feels whatever he does, it's not good enough for me and he thinks that he doesn't fit my vision for a partner. It's wrecking me because I love him and I've seen him make an effort to improve lately. Do you think Marcus' quote *""Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself""* applies differently to friends versus your significant other? Is it unreasonable to want your partner to reach the potential you see in them? The last thing I want is to be unreasonable and controlling. That's not healthy. I can't determine if we're just incompatible or if I'm setting unreasonable expectations for what I want in a partner.  I know comparison can be the death of happiness, but I see other couples in my friend group who seem to be better aligned in their core principles and views on health/consumerism/values. It's difficult to determine what is a ""must have"" in a relationship and what's a ""nice to have."" I'd hate to lose someone I love because I mistook an absent ""nice to have"" as a ""must have.""

relationship_advice,"I know it sounds pathetic.
Might be useful but I grew up with a traumatic childhood that led to attachment issues.
Basically for the past 3 years or so I’ve thought a friend of a friend was cute. He’s a friend of a lot of my friends so I added him to my private Snapchat story. But the thing is that I’ve become obsessed with him. I think it’s because I can imagine him how I like. After all, I’ve never actually held a conversation with him IRL. We’ve talked here and there when he replied to my stories the past three years but he’s a dry texter so it never ever went far. He knows at some point I thought he was cute and he might have a thing for me now but he’s shy so he won’t say anything.

Side note: the only way we communicate is through Snapchat. I’ve thought of unadding him but my hometown is super small and it would be super awkward if we saw each other after I did that. Also quite rude.

relationship_advice,"Hey Reddit.
I have been in a relationship now for 5 years. We are engaged, going to get married, we love each other and.. he has a huge dick. I am not exaggerating, it is often a problem. It is both big and thick. I always have to get used to it once it is in first, so that I get to the point of feeling pleasure instead of uncomfort. It doesn't help that I am very petite either.

So in the beginning of our relationship we used condoms - first cause we had just met, so obviously, but second because I was having a break from the pill (I had been taking them then for 11 years). It was hard for him, he used to always complain that they would hurt because they were too tight, even though we made sure to get XXL always.
Eventually I went back to the pill and after a couple of months in a committed relationship and we stopped using condoms altogether.

Fast forward 5 years later, I start having a lot of pain in different locations of my belly. Lower belly, on the side, around the stomach.. Did a bunch of exams and first it came out that I have fat liver and a stone in the gallbladder. My doctor said then that the liver issues might have been caused by the pill. Then, after two major pain crisis of the gallbladder, a knot was identified in the liver (I am getting an MRI tomorrow to check that out even) and other 4 stones in the gallbladder.
The doctors suggested me to take the gallbladder out, as there is no treatment for so many stones, and so I did. The comment of the first doctor stayed with me. I had already had my doubts on long term use of the pill, have stopped some times because of that, but alway went back to it as I had not many other choices. Maybe I am being a bit paranoid, but as I do not know for sure what was causing all of this shit, and after googling a lot on the side effects of the pill (that might even had been a mistake, I thought I was going to die many times 😅) and realising that it really could have caused the liver problems as well as the gallbladder stones, I decided to stop it for good, after 15 years on it - exactly half of my life.

That's been now over 2 months and ever since I have not had sex with my partner.
Part of it is due to the recovery of the surgery for the removal of the gallbladder, but other then that it is because he refuses to wear a condom now - and I obviously do not want to risk it, as it is yet not the time for children in our lives.

I must say that he is a very supportive partner. He knew about my issues with the pill from before and he always supported me on that too. I tried to look for other methods already before, but none of them really suited. The non hormonal spiral would've probably been the best alternative, if it wasn't for the fact of me being too small, and he too big.
He always got very frustrated about the fact of not existing pills for males.
But every time we have the ""sex talk"", it always goes the same way:
""so, what do we do?"", I suggest ""well with a condom"" and he goes on to say how horrible and uncomfortable it is for him to do that, how he does not feel absolutely nothing when he wears it.

That has honestly made me feel very disappointed and made me lose a lot of the sexual interest. I try a lot to think logically about it: so from one side I kind of understand him, because I do believe him when he says it is so horrible for him, but from the other I also don't, because I spent already half of my life being the one that has to take on the responsibility of the contraceptive (a third of that with him), which ended up fucking up my health (I mean, I even lost a freaking organ) and he can't even make the effort to try it?!

relationship_advice,"Hi there, this post may be a bit long so I apologize in advance. Also, English is not my native language, so please excuse any grammar mistakes or typos.

I’m (20F) from a relatively conservative/religious/heavily-controlled country. That is all I will disclose. A few years ago, my family was able to land me a government based scholarship/sponsorship that will aid in paying for all my expenses whilst studying as well as providing me with a job upon finishing. I know I must consider myself lucky for this, however, I never wanted this and was heavily pressured into it as I knew there were going to be a lot of restrictions down the line in life. I am studying medicine in Scotland with the help of a scholarship that my home country government provided me with.

My partner (19M) of 4 years almost is from Canada. For a while, we did long distance and he visited me as often as possible here in Scotland. He is a wonderful human being, he is so sweet and wonderful and is my rock. I’m lucky :) I did not disclose this relationship to my family as I knew they would not approve of me dating (they believe in going straight for marriage lol). They also wouldn’t like that he is white and wasn’t from their same religion (I am agnostic, but they don’t know this either).


Last year, while I was visiting my home country, I told my mum (f46) about this relationship and she was very angry with me and threatened to take away my scholarship and not let me leave for Scotland again if I did not end this relationship (yes, she does have the power to do this). So, I said that I did that, even though I didn’t.


I went back to Scotland, and my relationship with my mom has improved significantly and we have been a lot closer, calling on the phone every day for a decent amount of time too. I can’t help but feel that this is only because she believes I am doing what she wants me to and am leading the life she wants.


Meanwhile, my partner has been living with me for a year, yay! It’s been lovely tbh. However, my family doesn’t know, and this could land me in a world of trouble and loss.


My partner and I have been looking into me moving to Canada (spoke to attorney, it is doable)with him and getting married (we both want this). I am currently able to go for that option, however that would sorta mean I would have to pull the rug from under my family last minute before traveling to Canada and saying, ‘hey, I have lied and been living with a man before marriage, and will be leaving you all for good’. They would also go in debt because of my scholarship, a significant amount and would have to pay it back gradually. I want to work my ass off in Canada and be able to pay all of this back, as I know it is my responsibilities.


But my mum will be so disappointed in me for lying again. I kept this because I was afraid they would intervene and I’d never be able to leave. I hate my home country and don’t like what I’m doing at university too, I just want to be free. I have a diploma and some training that could get me a job and my partner has a decent paying job he could do until I land on my feet and work too. He always says to me ‘you feel free to be a stay-at-home wife and I will spoil you, if that’s what you want’ haha, which is so sweet and funny but I want to work to support too and pay my family back. Also, my partner and his family are lovely to me and I met his mum and she treats me like her daughter oh my god :”) my partner says he will supprort me no matter what happens and stay with me


If I go back to my home country, my future gov employers will not even let me marry this man if I wanted to (yes, they have the power)


I love my mum with all my heart. She raised me and my sibling as a single mum and is now finally in a relationship that is happy again with her new husband. I know she loves me, a lot, but won’t support me in this as I would be going against customs and religion. I couldn’t give less of a shit about my other family members as they are all dysfunctional. But I love my mum and sibling. They are expecting me to go back to my country next month, which is when we may go to Canada instead. They think I will be this amazing daughter and doctor, but I feel like a piece of shit for wanting a different lifestyle. For leading a double life and all.


My family will be shocked and disappointed. I mean what the fuck do I even say to my mum right before ? I can’t say anything sooner as they might intervene with my plans.


My mum broke her back trying to get me this scholarship and trying to give us this life, she is a loving person but I just wish she gave me more freedom to be human. She is the strongest lady I know.


I know the noble thing to do would be to suck it up, do uni and be the doctor and daughter my family wants me to be. But I love my partner, he is my soulmate, truly.


My family did not even meet or give my partner a chance. Mum spoke to him ONLY one time on the phone, telling him to never talk to me again, and even then he made her laugh because he is so funny and sweet lol.

relationship_advice,"My friend, (m25) and I (m26), have been friends since high school, and we have endured bouts of turbulence throughout the duration of the 8 years we have known each other.

This first bit of turbulence occurred a few months after we became friends. It got to the point where he would call or text me everyday asking to hangout, which became taxing since I am a person who also enjoys space and solitude outside of socializing. It eventually got to the point where I began to ignore him when he tried reaching out to me, and he would message me saying things like
""what's your problem?"" And "" can tell when somebody is willingly ignoring me."" However, after he tired himself out, 1 resumed contact with him several months later. This was in late 2015-early 2016.

Fast forward to May of 2017. He and I were supposed to hangout one night, but I was running late and gave him a heads up that I would make it over as soon as possible. A half hour after the initial planned time that we were supposed to hangout, he texted me saying ""hey I'm gonna go hangout with other people instead,"" which made me upset, and I told him that I wasn't happy about him ditching our plans. He then played the victim, claiming that I was taking too long, and we didn't talk for several days. When we did talk about it, he said to me,
""get over it, you're just butt hurt,"" which I didn't appreciate, but I let it slide.

That was when the dynamic of our friendship began to get weird. Up until then, we were typically hanging out several times a week. After that, he and I saw each other maybe several times a year for the next four years and he would sometimes take days to respond when I reached out to him.

Things between us, however, came to a head in March of 2020 right before lockdown. We were planning on going to a concert that April, and I bought the tickets with the plan of him reimbursing me. As the outlook of the world became grim, the concert was cancelled. I informed him about the cancellation via text, and said ""good thing you didn't pay me,"" to which he replied with a thumbs up emoji. A week went by, and we made plans to hangout the following day. After I got off work the next day, I tried calling him. He didn't pick up. I waited several hours before texting him saying ""hey man I tried calling you earlier to ask when you wanted to hangout."" He responded by saying ""I know."" That was when I knew something was up. He then texted me saying ""maybe I would hangout if you weren't so shallow and passive-aggressive."" | responded by asking him what he meant, which he replied: ""good thing I didn't pay you? It seems like you only ever hit me up when I owe you money"" (he never owed me money prior to that). I explained that I didn't mean the ""good thing you didn't pay me"" message with negativity. Nevertheless, he continued to berate me via text.

A couple weeks later, he called me and apologized for how he treated me, and I forgave him. Throughout the course of 2020 I was a recluse due to health and anxiety reasons, so we saw one another very scarcely but remained in loose communication. By the spring of 2021, he started asking more frequently to hangout. However, I was still in a reclusive state and didn't want to hangout with anyone until I got the jab, so I told him that. But apparently that wasn't a good enough reason and he would say things like ""are you really this scared of the virus or do you just not want to hangout with me?"" Even though those comments bugged me, I gave him respectful responses.

By May of 2021 I was fully jabbed and he knew it. He also knows I have an anxiety disorder. One day we planned on hanging out, he asked if I could pick him up, and I suggested that we drive to the hangout destination separately. He didn't like that and said ""so you're still going to be weird and distant to me even though you're jabbed. Nice."" And ""if you don't want to hangout with me just say it."" This hurt my feelings because he knew that I have anxiety issues and wasn't being sympathetic at all.
But once again, I let it slide, and we hungout.
This attitude towards me continued for the next several months until I had enough. I told him via text that I was hurt from being ridiculed by him for my anxiety disorder.
At first, he apologized, but as I refused to accept his apology, he flew into a rage. I quit responding to the texts, so he called me 22 times in a row, showed up to my house and banged on the door, and I hid out of sight. He then texted and called me a ""fucking pussy"" and
""coward."" Afraid that he was going to come back and get violent, I called the cops, and he quit messaging and calling.

6 months passed, and I decided to reach out to him. We talked things over and smoothed things out, and we had remained in a healthy friendship until 2 weeks ago when he began accusing me of not wanting to hangout with him. The thing is, I'm in college and I have been helping take care of my dad who suffered a stroke back in March, so I don't have a lot of free time on my hands. My friend is aware of my current situation, but he still accuses me of willfully ignoring him.

Looking at our friendship in retrospect, I have noticed a pattern of him having bouts of being accusatory towards me, which eventually turns into him getting angry and me and bullying me. The thing is, he and I have had a lot of good times together too, but the turbulence is stressful and I don’t know what to do about it at this point.

relationship_advice,"This is a a repsonse and update to what has happened since my previous post about my parents being mad at me for lying and deciding to go see my bf in Florida behind their back. (Context: i have to have a yes or no from my parents on any decision/ thing that i want to do so i lied and hid my trip from them). 

So because I lied, there are consequences.  They told me what my consequences are from my decision making and what I need to do to regain their trust. And if I want to be under their covering in the home, I need to obey what they say.

The main thing they said I have to stop the relationship with my bf 100%. A full break! No talking, no text, calls, nothing with him. Until I earn their trust back and until they say it’s okay! My dad said I have till the end of the week to tell my bf. Which means no talking, no communication whatsoever until further notice and they will say when I can talk to him again. They told me this time would be for me to reestablish myself. Focus on things I need to work on, rebuilding my relationship with my parents and THEN after all that, then I can have a better relationship with my bf.

Me choosing them over my bf shows that they are more important and that I’m being obedient to God’s will by being obedient to them. Then again, my dad said that I’m an adult and can make my own decisions. So they are not forcing me to do anything. But to make my own decisions you have to get out of the house because I’m not obeying them. But then they also say that I have consequences and there’s things that are going to be in place if I want to have their blessing. They say that they’re not forcing me to do anything, but if I want to regain their trust, there are consequences and I have to follow them if I am truly sorry and want a relationship with them. 

Not sure what to think, but this isn’t fair. I’m only being controlled if I stay there. This is unfair for my bf, for me, for our relationship. My own sister is saying that I will continue to be controlled if I stay. She said that they are always going to try and keep me as close as they can because I am their blood and only daughter (my siblings are adopted). She wasn’t mad about saying that, she believes that’s why they are hardest on me. My parents say that they are protective, but they’re only controlling me because they can’t live without seeing me. I said dang  you’re right. She said, ""I know (ur bf) and his parents don't want you to go to Florida just so you can escape, but I think you will never get to grow up and learn if you stay here and comply so you gotta go. You leaving is the only way. Silas should understand your situation and know you're not escaping, but just wanting to be in a healthier environment.""

One  friend said they think my bf will understand if I explain to him why I might be MIA for a little bit, which will show his character if he is committed/ willing to wait it out for a bit. She said I am worth waiting it out for and if he sees that too, he will wait. She also sees my situation and can personally relate so she's not saying to just obey them, but explaining to Silas what's going on can help, which of course I plan to do. 

I’m going to tell him what’s going on of course. My parents even said to tell him straight up that this is what they’re telling me to do. It’s just not fair because it’ll make him feel more uncomfortable with being with me. It’s true. Because it’s not healthy. His parents don’t want him in an uncomfortable position and family. I don't want that for him either. That’s why his parents want to make sure I’m okay with my parents and we are okay. Which is true. I obviously want a healthy relationship with my parents. But like this?? I know this is not fair. But it’s sad because I will lose him because I have controlling parents. 

Only thing I know is that I will tell my bf what is going on and what I’m willing to do because I don’t want to be controlled anymore. He may understand. But I just know this will make him feel more uncomfortable to be in a relationship with me. And my parents will be the ones driving him away. He doesn't need all this drama. I don't either. Thankfully I have places to stay and have people that are watching out for me (and my relationship with him) who don't want to see me controlled nor be forced to stop my relationship until I'm told it's okay. 

I will continue to be in a relationship with him. If my bf wants to stop it for him then that's different. If he is okay with waiting a little bit (meaning we could be committed to each other) while things are being worked on with my parents, then okay I'll definitely appreciate his willingness and understanding. I still think in the end, he will grow tired of this, especially if he is willing to wait in the beginning. And at that point, I would find myself without the person I love + in an unhealthy situation with my parents because I obeyed their regulations in hopes to be with my bf after things are okay, yet not be in a relationship with him. AH! 

Advice:.... move out and tell my parents that they can't control my relationship? Do I stay and comply to have a better relationship and gain trust back with my parents, yet tell my bf we can't talk for a bit? This is real life ppl, not a made up story hahaha!!",0,Me (23) bf (22) and my parents controllingmy life and relationship.,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8863887,1682458541,0,1682458560,1682458560,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,11,1032
relationship_advice,"I am struggling a lot with this. My boyfriend is wonderful, he’s funny, athletic, and he cooks. We have been together for over a year and a half. I have never been in a relationship where I like someone this much and its the longest relationship I’ve been in, but the small tiffs that happen feel like they are all just adding together and now I am unsure what to do. I feel like my needs are not met or I am not being respected enough.

For examples, he was 4 months late in giving me my anniversary present. He was busy with school and work, which I understand and I try very hard to be patient, but even after 4 extra months to work on something his gift was one small handmade thing, while I had gotten him 3 main things(one made by hand)with some sweets to go with. 

My boyfriend also tends to run on the childish side, which is fine we have fun acting silly with each other, but he doesn’t know when to stop. There have been times where he has acted childish when I am trying to have an actual conversation or communicate a problem with him. Not to mention he can be very impulsive, as he has thrown my watch and phone across the room before as well as some chocolate I made for him up towards a fan. (He initially was throwing up gift paper from his anniversary gift to see the paper fly off after hitting the fan, but then he threw the bagged chocolate up too, he thought it was also paper somehow, but it still fees like he just doesn’t pause and double check what he’s actually doing sometimes). He also usually doesn’t clean up after himself until much later(ex:left a cup of orange juice out overnight/leaves ingredients out on the table for long periods). 

It also feels as though he’s quite selfish at times. To give some example, recently we went to the store to get batteries for a light up item he bought. When we got there he asked if I could buy them. Usually I am ok with helping out, but I do not have a job right now. He has a job, so even though I get its not fun to spend money I felt it was unfair to ask me to pay when I do not have an income. He was whining saying the batteries were expensive and his paycheck goes towards savings and food money(which he doesn’t really need since he lives at home and there is a lot of food there, he just likes to go out). It felt very aggravating hearing that because I am trying to save money too especially since I don’t have a job right now. I only spend if its a necessity or I feel like getting a rare treat. 

This goes along with the frustration that he doesn’t get me things.(unfortunately I consider my love language gifting). He will buy me food occasionally, but he has never gotten me flowers despite my asking of them(idc if its bought it could be flowers from the side of the road i just want to see a sweet gesture from him). He didn’t buy me a valentines gift until after telling him my disappointment and his anniversary gift was late too as previously mentioned. Meanwhile, he has recently bought himself an expensive baseball glove despite only playing for fun with his church. An $80 real life game item, as well as a new monitor which was around $300. I can understand the monitor because it is very nice and he does esports, but it just feels jarring that he buys himself stuff all the time, but cant muster up to time to get me flowers.

These traits are not a constant occurrence, but its more often than Id like, every time something new happens it feels like its another thing sent to the pile that makes me question the worth of sticking it out. Usually he is very patient with me and we communicate well(I do not refrain from sharing how I feel about something that has upset me), but it feels like im just nagging him at times because when I bring up something he will get sad and go quiet. 

I guess I am just asking for some outside perspective on what to do. My friends know he is a good guy, but this stuff is really bothering and they think he needs to really up his act. I don’t want to breakup with him, but it feels like its becoming an inevitable if I hold any self respect. 

He loves me a lot and every time I talk to him he wants to improve and says he will work to be a better bf, but I am getting impatient. I know some change cannot be seen or made that quickly, but should I continue to stick it out in hopes he keeps his word? Do I need to be less needy? Im not sure what to do.  

Tldr; my boyfriend has been selfish and childish and its really starting to bother me. I communicate with him and he wants to do better, but things feel like they’re piling up despite it all. I don’t want to leave because there is a lot of good to him, but it feels like im disrespecting myself by being so patient on the undesirable matters.

Before I start saying what I’ve been doing to self sabotage.. yes i’m aware I’m self sabotaging and no i can’t stop in the moment. So i’ve been burned pretty bad in the past and i mean in every single relationship i’ve ever been in long or short i’ve been seriously f*cked over. So I feel like I definitely carry that hurt over and I don’t mean to. I’m very jealous and paranoid. Sometimes i’ll randomly think about if my boyfriend is cheating on me (with no proof) and then i’ll question him about it and sometimes i’ll even threaten to break up with him over this. I also worry about him having work gfs or meeting women at the gym. Most of the time I don’t mention this to him unless he brings up other women at his work or gym.. it kinda sends me into a spiral. I feel really bad after these things happen and i’m terrified of losing him because of it. I seriously cannot stop myself in the moment, i fully convince myself he’s cheating or lying to me. I know this has to be from past relationship trauma but I just don’t know what to do, I can’t lose him. I love him so much.

relationship_advice,"For context I just moved to my new state , right now I am having a tough time in my life , lonely , fresh out a breakup and lost in my career ( marine biologist ) 
I met a guy online let’s call him Eddie , I have the bad habit ( that I am working on fix ) to like men attention on the internet usually I like to flirt with people that live in other countries and that I can’t meet physically ( cause I am somehow disgusted at men physically I am bi and prefer girls) but male attention became addictive to me ( I am definitely working on it ) 

I met Eddie online through shared interests and because we work in the same field ( marine biologist ) we started to have some flirting conversations but somehow because he is really funny and I did liked him I didn’t wanted to be purely flirty or sexual with him. He has however asked me weird questions which positions I like and we have talked about sexual scenarios , he suggested a spicy video call but i declined. To my surprise he lives near me which made me panic. 

He has children, he is single and we have things in common he offered to help in my career which I desperately need , we agreed to be friends with each other and he is wanting to meet he said to meet as his home but I suggested public place of course tough I am dreaded to meet , we talk every day and he is funny and cool he has treated me as a friend totally now but I am still nervous I don’t have the best relationship with my parents and I have 0 independence so when I am sad I get comfort on him and all the plans he has to make me happy.

relationship_advice,"I knew a guy that I consider a best friend, honestly share my sense of humor and jokes and also prospective in a lot of things. Recently before the midterm elections we started talking politics as all friends do, He's conservative. I'm a liberal. I respected that from day one.


I would send him conservative/liberal memes (at the time it was impossible not to talk about politics because of Roe. V. Wade) here and there but then when we got into talking about Biden, He would say that he's ruining the country and he's the worst ever, red wave blah blah blah.



I got to the point where I told him. Hey I respect your views. Let's talk about something else? And we did all good right?


No, turns out that we could share memes and talk about internet stuff but then politics would sneak up and if I didn't agree with him the conversation would go nowhere.


Anyways, I decided to stop talking to him for 6 months, after the election and everything died down I tried talking to him, but he views me as a ""radical leftist"" for my posting and my views overall it's like he can't get those out of the way and we can't have any conversations at all.


Anyways, I tried posting about this to other post explaining my situation and lots of people were saying that that's not a real friend, That's not what friends do and friends stay together.


Anyways these are the things for my perspective. I don't know his, Im I being the asshole?

relationship_advice,"Let's call her M. M is very outgoing and social so am i. We've been in a relationship from 7 months (I know a very short period of time). However due to her avoidant behaviour, I just can't cope with it anymore. I'm really confused. It was great during the first two or three months however soon i realised we don't do anything together and when i asked her, she said she doesn't want to get too close to me. Some things which generally all the people do in a relationship (i think) such as - 
1. Sleeping Together
2. Sex
3. Working out together
4. Hanging out with each other's friends
5. Cuddling
6. Spending nights
I was planning to move to the building she lives in ( Not her flat, That's a quite large building which has 300 or more flats) and she said don't. She said she doesn't want to live that close to me. She said she's not comfortable with sleeping together or sex. She said her love language is different so she doesn't want to cuddle either. However, She texts me full day about everything she's doing and where she's going. But when I'm with her she's on her phone most of the time. Last time when i told her (I've already talked to her about this many times because she said she wants me to communicate) She started to cry. She was avoiding physical intimacy(we had it 2 times in last 2 months) apart from hugs and kisses but the very next day she was so much into it. I thought something changed but i was wrong and it was just one day thing. I don't think she isn't interested or attracted to me because I've already met all of her friends. I tried hard. Tried to help her in every way possible from cooking meals when she's busy to always being available when she needs me to taking her out on nice places and everything i could afford. Tried to get involved in her life. Told her how much she means to me and I'm not going to abandon her. Literally cared for her like a child because she had very bad eating habits. It has done nothing good for the relationship apart from leaving me drained. I literally felt like begging for her love. All she says is she can't get close to me as she hasn't done it with anybody ( I'm the first guy she's in a relationship with) Not ever her family.
Some good things about her- 
Doesn't ignore me when i get hurt and she agreed that it's all her and she doesn't know how I'm taking all the bs she's giving me and she feel terrible for that.
I'm planning to move out of this relationship now. I don't think loving her more will do any good to her. It's only making it more and more painful for me everyday. I didn't want her to make any efforts i just wanted her to love me back but i guess that's never gonna happen.

Good: he was soft, calm, respectful, not violent (never even raised his voice), worried about me, I could count on him, and a he was great, present father. 
Bad: he was not a good provider and relied heavily on me. He was not romantic with me-he didn’t want to kiss me, we never went on dates, he didn’t write me notes, or told me he loved me. I cried on a birthday because not even happy birthday he would wish me. He  had issues with alcohol and cheated on me. He avoided conflict and wouldn’t talk about anything. I was “alone with someone” 
Needless to say, it ended. 

2- my current relationship. Of almost 5 years (F35 and M40) I left my country, my job, my friends, basically my life to be with him. We have a good relationship. 

Good: he is a good provider, he is reliable, he is a good stepfather and father. He is calm and communicative. He is ambitious and organized. He is romantic. 

Bad: he also has an issue with alcohol and a self destructive personality. He spaces off and half the time I’m talking, he’s not listening to me. He cannot control his urge to sext. He did it while we were dating, when we got married (even the day of our marriage), when I was pregnant abs even after our kid was born. 

❓When I found out at first, I had already left everything and thought he could change. I was heartbroken, disgusted, ashamed. Then every time after that, we had major fights. He finally admitted he was wrong, but never quit it. The last time I found out, I had no more tears, or sadness, or horror, or shock. Just emptiness where once was love and the fear of losing it. 
I quit my job to look after our baby. I cook and clean and look after the baby all day. 

I’m torn. I see how this damaged our relationship, but tell myself “there’s nothing better.

relationship_advice,"I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (21M) for three years now but have known each other for almost five. We have had an extremely smooth relationship for these past years and are like each other's best friends. We moved abroad together for university and in September last year, moved into a flat together. We love our apartment and our life together, at least I still do. 

January this year, my boyfriend left to Asia to study abroad for a semester (Jan til May) while I am still here in Europe studying. All was perfect before he left and during the first two months he was away. We were in a great place in our relationship and he would show his love in so many ways. He sent me roses and a card for valentines day, wrote messages on how much he loved me around the house (before he left) and generally was very affectionate and caring. 

During March, I went to visit him in Asia and this is when things took a turn. I knew something was off in my gut the first day I saw him. Nothing awful just that he felt very distant and something was weird. I initially was upset about this and confronted him to which he said there was nothing to worry about. For the whole trip, I felt this feeling that he was distant but decided not to bring it up again. However, on the last night, he confined to me that he felt like he had changed in certain ways and I asked if he had changed in terms of our relationship, and he reassured me that it had nothing to do with it. When I arrived back in Europe, we spoke for a few days then I decided to put some distance between me and him to see how he would react. I now regret this however, at the time I thought it would sort of get him to come round and not act so distant. I felt upset that he was so distant during the trip and I wanted more attention.

We did eventually come round to having a call around the time of my birthday and I expressed to him that I felt upset that he was distant and I was experiencing negative emotions. It was a sad call however, he was travelling at the time and didn't really have much to say about my emotions or how he acted. He did apologise but that was about it. We then go for about a week without texting and then I message him with the suggestion that we have another call. This is where things really take a turn. 

Within the first 5 minutes of the call, he tells me he's breaking up with me without giving a solid reason why. I was absolutely shocked and did not see this coming. There has been no sort of communication with why he was distant these past weeks or why he feels the way he does in ANY conversation. This quite literally torn my heart in two. I felt confused to the situation as I had only seen him for 10 days while in Asia. How could he make a decision like this when he hasn't even spoken to me about his feelings? We have a home and life together in Europe. After speaking on the phone with me basically just crying for an hour, we agreed that it would be a ""break"" and we would speak when he gets home. He told me that he is going through some emotions and needs to work through it. 

It has now been four days since that call and I just get more and more confused everyday. The last time I was with him in our flat and home, our relationship was in an amazing place. I feel like something terrible has happened without anything actually happening in the relationship. It's hard for me because the last memories I had of him at home were amazing so why are we not together? I am going crazy because I feel like I have been totally shut out of the situation and have no control over it. I am giving him the distance he needs but I can't help but think, the key to a good relationship is open communication. I kept telling myself that surely he is going to come home and come back to his senses and feelings. I understand living somewhere so different from what you are used to can make you not feel the same way or feel distant. Also yes, living abroad can change you in many ways but how do feelings like this disappear and make you make rash decisions like this.  When he was distant when I visited him, I knew he was off but not to this extent.

I don't believe that feelings can disappear in a month (up until March he was totally normal) and I know he did love me before and at the begin of the semester. I am posting this to ask if anyone has been in a similar situation or has advice. I know he is a good person and this has nothing to do with other girls or sleeping around. But do you think it is normal for people to sort of freak out at their relationships when abroad. I think he has a lot of emotions he doesn't understand which is causing him to lash out like this.

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year now (we’ve known each other for 2 years). I’m moving to a city, still in our state, that’s about an hour away so that I can go back to university. I plan to move in July/August.

Currently, we don’t live together. We’ve talked about my move here and there, and understandably we always get really sad talking about it since we won’t be as accessible to each other anymore. He’ll make jokes such as “Let me come with you and I’ll live in your closet or something” or “Put me in your pocket and take me to [city name] with you.”

I always jokingly shut his proposals down, but a part of me feels like he might be open to living with me. He oftentimes gets really nervous to take initiative if there’s a chance he might be rejected, so even if he wanted to live with me, I fear he might not be courageous enough to ask anyway.

His roommates are moving out of town next year, so he won’t have any roommates to stay with anymore. He also has a job here that he’s been at for the past 3 years, but that he doesn’t plan on staying at for a long time. We also do little “sleepovers” where we stay with each other Friday through Sunday, and sleep at my apartment every weekend night, so I feel we’d do well together in a living situation, even through the growing pains.

I’ve never lived with a SO before, so this would be my first time. And I know that there’s a chance he’ll say no to me asking him to move with me, which does make me incredibly nervous. but I feel like it’s at least worth a try. I’m just unsure of how to go about it.

Later, when I was walking out of the restroom, I saw her talking to him and he had his phone out. This is out of character for her.  A few days later she lied about going out with friends, stayed the night with this guy, and went to work directly from his place. Obviously, it was planned since she had a change of clothes. However, she had told me that she drank too much and stayed with a friend but somehow she had the extra clothes with her. I saw the texts between them the next night and it was clear they hooked up. He had sent her a message saying she should have called into work so they could have stayed in bed all day. I broke up with her and made her move out.

Her sister called me telling me my ex was saying frightening things (I thought she was only saying this to her sister to try to make me feel bad and force me back into her life) and she ended up in the hospital a few days later. Her mom and sister are begging me to come see her but I’ve refused so far. She is being looked at for histrionic personality disorder. I don’t know anything about this but I cannot see how this would excuse cheating, especially since she has never done anything like this before. The doctor did call me and ask me to visit since my ex said I was her bf but i told the doc what really happened and she should call the other guy instead. The doctor was confused because my ex hadn't mentioned him at all.

I need advice on if I should go to the hospital or not. I don’t think there is a chance for us but she keeps asking for me and she has tried to get them to call me since I blocked her.

relationship_advice,"33f 26m, 4 months duration of spending time so far. 

Hi everyone,

I’ve been longtime suspicious of my situationship of being dishonest and the last month has been bad in terms of communication and lying. 

I finally said screw it, whatever you’re doing, I’m doing worse. Petty but required. I sent that message. He replied “is someone else texting you now?” And I sent a kiss emoji. 

Then I ghosted for ten days. My phone blew up afterhours Friday and he was begging and pleading and said sorry he was just thinking but he “didn’t want to hurt my feelings” so he didn’t reply but he knows this is what he wants, is in love etc. and just wants to see me. 

I said no but he replied with a picture of an en route Uber. I let him in and we argued and none of his excuses made sense as usual, but I gave up and I calmed down, slept and dropped him off Saturday morning. Haven’t heard from him since after texting Saturday evening. 

Why do men do this? He swears up and down he has no one else (I only care because of STDs, nothing else) and he’s been alone this whole time. I told him it sounds like he hit a rough patch with someone else and spun the block. 

Why would he spend hours saying sorry and begging me to talk to him and call me his “queen” just to immediately RE-GHOST me? I’m not gonna wonder if I did anything wrong but I think he needs to get blocked at this point.

Hello, my girlfriend broke up with me like 2 weeks ago. It wasn’t that great of an end to our relationship that lasted over a year. She messaged me about a weak after asking if we could hangout. I said yes and she came over that night. She told me she still had feelings for me and that she might want to get back together later but we agreed to just be friends for the time being. The next day, she sent me a text saying she doesn’t want to have any contact with me for at least a month. I felt like I was being emotionally manipulated with her back and forth comments so I said that I wouldn’t contact her anymore and we couldn’t be friends either. It’s been a week since then without any contact and I have a sick feeling in my stomach with bad dreams.

relationship_advice,"So I'm brand new to reddit and I'm not really sure how all this works but I'm just going to post this and see what happens. So I met this girl and she was dating somebody else at the time and broke up with him and jumped into a relationship with me approx. 2 weeks after, so not a whole lot of time to process that for her, anyways things were going really well for about a month and we fell in love and fantasized about our future together and I was really happy and I could tell she was too. I had a trip booked with family about a month into this new hot and exciting relationship, and while I was gone my gf at the time had a horrible week and I wasn't there to support/comfort her because I was in a different country, she got into a car accident and totaled her car and had an unrelated injury at work which she is still dealing with. We both felt like crap while I was away and when I came back the connection with her wasn't the same. She was becoming distant and wasn't express very much feelings/affection towards me, I was hopelessly head over heels in love with her and I started to get the feeling she didn't want to be with me anymore, after some deep and heartfelt conversations she felt she needed some time and space from me and decided she's not ready to be in a relationship right now. She says she still loves me and wants to keep me around as a friend for a while and maybe explore the possibility of getting back together one day, and I hope that is the case. But I can't tell if she really does still love me and truly wants me at a later date or if that isn't the case. We both have people pleasing character traits so I fear that she's just trying to let me go slowly and as least painful as possible. When we ended our relationship she did cry alot and I was trying to be the bigger man and support her through that, and it hit me just a couple days ago and I shed some tears I miss her alot and I hope that one day we can get back to where we were at the start of our relationship or at least somewhere close to that.

relationship_advice,"We were dating for 9 months. He went to travel for a week and never responded to any of my calls. He came back yesterday and he was like probably bored at his place and wanted to FaceTime me. The air quality of my place was little suspicious because I was coughing so bad I was wearing a mask and I explained to him that am having an allergic reaction. 

We had an argument about him following onlyfans girls on Twitter. I told him he can keep them and he must remove every single picture of me on his phone. I thought he would chose to remove the girls instead. 

He hangup because I refused to remove the mask and literally broke up with me because he is like you aren't allowing me to see you and told me to remove your pictures. Is this a legit reason for breakup? I feel like he was looking for a reason to break up with me and he is just making excuses.

relationship_advice,"I always keep losing people when I reveal my emotions, what do I do

I am 22 f. I got out of a messy 5 year relationship with a woman, last year. I am bisexual Muslim woman, so I dealt with all this shit In all whispers. My best friends also betrayed me few months before my break up and they wer toxic as hell.
But they all keep saying I can't Care for u and your emotions.
Whenever I get close to someone, I tend to reveal my Happiest and darkest moods all at the same time. I try my best to hide myself, but they can read my face. I thought I was the problem and isolated myself from everyone..

But its hard, as I am a social person who wants friends and someone to listen to but I have no one except my brother and only 1 long distance friend. They have been my rock.
This year, I download tinder and tried to look for someone I could befriend and try dating..because I am tired of being alone.
I found someone 28 N B. Somehow we clicked and from day 1, we wer on calls and laughing and enjoying and getting know each other. They could read every face I made.
I am struggling in life,and via thier recommendation I got a good job 2 months ago. First few days at work everything was amazing, the Jon was good, they took care of me and there was even romance. I tried to be closed off, but I got close and opened up. Things wer amazing...then they said they didn't want a relationship, I agreed...we keep things simple, doesn't have to be a relationship. Because my family is strict and i have time limits, i hage sneaked around eith them and have had fun in the past. And it genuinely felt like they liked me. This was going on for 2 months,  But thier ex came back into thier life and although I expected, they got distant from me..
I had a conversation with them today..
They said I was never close to them and although they did care about me, they can't give back to how they wer and they can't handle my emotions and me because they have alot of things going on.
I knew about it, they never really opened up to Me In details, I was aware and somehow I burdened my feelings onto they.
My situationship also ended...
Do I force my emotions onto them or force them into caring for me just because they wer nice to me ?
The advice I would like from you guys, is how to avoid such said situations, how do I make a person stay without making them deal with any of my emotions.
How do I shut myself from expressing my emotions so that people can stay.
How do I fake being normal?
I have anxious attachment issues, anytime person I care about has slight behavioural change, I go crazy and overassume
How do I hide my crazy self...so atleast I don't lose even a friend or a situationship?
Is my only solution to become radio silent and never talk to anyone like I did before?

When I am alone I am numb and I can pretend everything is okay, but once someone becomes nice to me, I blurt..
How do I avoid that?

relationship_advice,"I’m probably overthinking this

Okay, so a man I knew in high school (we weren’t necessarily friends or anything we were just acquaintances who occasionally hung out in the same groups) added me on social media and messaged me about a year ago. I was going through a really tough time at the time and opened the message but didn’t answer. 

Now it’s been almost a year later and I want to thank him for the message, it was very kind, and see how he’s doing but I also don’t want to be rude or anything by answering literally so long after he sent it.

relationship_advice,"I just found out I’m pregnant a few days ago. We’re very excited, but it’s very new and scary. 

For context, my husband is the guy who always volunteers to help any friend or family. We have a great relationship and happen to be very independent people with our own agendas. We usually just give each other a heads up about our commitments, but we’ve never stopped the other from signing up for something. I have a lot of hobbies so the amount of time he volunteers doesn’t bother me at all… Until now. 

Without getting into too many specifics, my husband told me his family’s business is suffering and that his parents need help. They’re not asking for money but came to their children and explained theyre in a bad spot. They want to fire some of their employees and are asking their children to volunteer their time to do the admin work and help make decisions. They won’t be paid for this. 

I’m not close to my family so maybe I just don’t get it, but this seems odd to me. They’re essentially all going into business together, and they’re kind of a volatile group. They bicker and fight about money. What’s worse is that my husband is by far the most responsible sibling in the bunch and I’m worried he’ll just swoop in and do everything. 

Apparently when they had this conversation my husband said he’d do anything they needed. He didn’t talk to me about it first. I asked what kind of time commitment this is and he explained he thinks it will take about 8 hours a week. He’s planning on just doing it every Sunday. When I asked how long this would last, he told me it would probably take 3-5 years to get them out of the hole. 

I asked how he feels about this with a baby (thinking he would understand) and he simply responded, “Yeah, it’s a lot.” 

I just stared at him dumbfounded and finally asked who was going to watch the baby every Sunday for 8 hours? By committing his time, he was committing me to a full day of childcare alone. If it really came down to his family losing everything or this option, I might do it, but he didn’t even ask. He just subconsciously assumed I’d take on that burden. 

I also don’t know if I WOULD do it. If they’re not profitable, I don’t think it makes sense to continue this business at the expense of everyone’s free labor, including mine. 

I could see in his eyes that my labor hadn’t even crossed his mind, which somehow makes it more hurtful. 

We both work full time. I make more money than him but our jobs are pretty equally demanding. Even if I was a SAHM, I think it’s incredibly selfish to volunteer 8 hours a week without talking to your pregnant partner, but we had committed to splitting childcare duties 50/50 when we’re not working. 

To his credit, he saw how hurt I was and immediately apologized and was genuinely so upset. He said he’d never had to consider this when volunteering his time before and he just acted without thinking. 

We tried to find a compromise. 

At first he said I could have 8 hours on Sat to do “anything I wanted” while he watched our baby, but this seems impractical. We wouldn’t have a single full day of the week we spent as a family. He then said he’d just quit when the baby came, but this also seems impractical. His parents want to FIRE their employees, which means they’re going to rely heavily on him, and I don’t trust his siblings to step up. I think he’s stuck in this undertaking. 

We agreed to give it a few days to think about it. TBH, it hurt my feelings so much that he just inherently knew he could dump 8 hours of sole childcare onto my plate without asking, I’m having a hard time seeing this rationally (again, he’s apologized a million times but I’m shook). 

I don’t want their family to lose their business, but I don’t see a practical way to make this work and I don’t think this is fair. I thought about asking my husband to set realistic hours, but I’m so afraid he’s going to get sucked in and do it all anyway.

relationship_advice,"A couple weekends ago my friend invited me out to the bar to meet a friend of hers (25F, we’ll call her A). We hit it off almost instantly and were tied to the hip the rest of the night. There were about 8 of us total in this group and we didn’t really talk to anyone else. We even smoked some weed outside of the bar and came back in and danced together for a bit before she had to leave. While she was leaving I asked for her number and she didn’t hesitate to give it to me and told me to text her later. I asked if she got home safe later that night and vice versa and it seemed like I had finally found a connection again after being single for a couple of years. 

I texted A the next day about something she said she’d tell me more about and the conversation was going great. I asked my friend if I should ask A on a date since things were going so well and she told me to go for it, so I did. Once the text convo started to die down I asked her if she wanted to get dinner with me and she replied saying she’d love to go as friends since she’s not looking for anything serious right now. While I was a bit disappointed since those were not the vibes I was getting at all from her, I still really enjoyed spending time with her the previous night and wanted to follow through with the plans. Oddly, the next day after this exchange, A left me on delivered the whole day before finally confirming the plans the morning of. I was seriously considering not going since it seemed weird that A didn’t respond for a whole day, but I asked my friend and she said I should still go.

We ended up going to dinner and to be honest, it almost did feel like a date. We had a great time, talked nonstop, and even made a few tentative plans including our mutual friend. When the bill came she said we should split it and I agreed since it technically wasn’t a date (I believe the man should fully pay when it is a first date). We hugged goodbye and while I was driving home she told me to let her know when I got home. I told my friend about that text and she thought it was cute and a sign that there is a chance we could be more than friends in the future.

After that night I didn’t text her at all to try and keep that friendly distance. Of course A never texted me either, but she liked a couple of my Instagram stories this past weekend and even commented on one of them. I know that probably doesn’t mean much, but I don’t go around liking people’s stories willy-nilly and I especially only comment on stories of people I’m close with. She left me on read after I responded to her comment (it wasn’t anything too serious so I understand this), and that’s where we’re at right now.

I asked one of my guy friends about this situation and he thinks I screwed myself over for even agreeing to go to the dinner after A said she wanted to go as friends and subsequently not confirming the plans for a whole day and that’s where I’m stuck. He basically said I should’ve waited to hang out with her more in a group setting before making a move. I definitely see what he’s getting at, but all of this dating rhetoric nowadays is about the man taking charge and I constantly see girl’s prompts on their hinge profiles saying to ask them out by naming a time and a place and making it easy for them. 

I do have a massive crush on A now and I’m not 100% sure if I could be friends with her if I don’t lose these feelings. 

I guess I just need advice on where to set my expectations. I honestly can’t stop thinking about her and if we are just going to remain friends then I need to start changing my mindset now before I get hurt. I’ve been in situations like this in the past and it always ends up being ugly.

relationship_advice,"I (M27) have been seeing my GF (F23) for about 4 months. We met through work and everything has been great. We have been able to separate work from life well. I introduced her to my family and friends, as she has done the same to me. This post is being written for this reason, her position requires her to move out of state in a year, possibly less. I am born and raised in this state, all of my family and friends are nearby. She is in the same boat, however she is wanting to leave, which is one reason why she took the position she is in now. I initiated the relationship knowing knowing this, however I thought there would be more time together (1 full year) before she would leave, however it is looking like it is less. I understand I knew the risk of getting into the relationship where she is set on moving, but I am finding it tough to pick up and follow. I am not career oriented, however the family, friends, and comfort bubble I have formed here is hard for me to reason as expendable. 
We have spoken on this subject, and there are potentially different cities she can land, and would be willing to plan together to go to a place of mutual interest. While thoughtful, I’m having second thoughts of leaving, and don’t want to be the reason she stay and resent me in the future for “tying her down.” She is willing to try long distance but with it being 500+ miles, I feel long distance is extremely tough, especially in such a new relationship. 
My question, do I endure the pain and end it now, before it continues to develop, play it by ear and see what happens, or try something new and risk it? I’m in an industry where finding a job shouldn’t be too difficult.

relationship_advice,"TLDR: me and my boyfriends relationship has been toxic for pretty much its entire duration (over a year). The biggest thing I mentioned when trying to break up with him was him being really mean to me during arguments, as well as the deprecating jokes he would make all the time. He says he can change and be better, as I'm sure he can, but I'm just not happy anymore. I don't know how to move on from here.

On Friday night, we were watching a movie on discord (we are in a long distance relationship because he is in college and I'm in high school), and I got up to go to the bathroom. When I came back to my computer, he had hung up the phone. I called him back a few times and asked him why he hung up and he just said it was because he was tired. I said why couldn't you just wait until I get back to tell me that and he said he was going to message me but hadn't yet. He was being really short in the messages, and made a joke that the reason why he left was because I was taking too long. This seems like a really small thing, because it is, but I just felt done. There have been times in the past where he has been really mean to be during arguments, getting nasty and saying ""fuck you"", as well as pretty much not talking to me the entire first semester he was in college. He didn't get me anything for Valentines day and then got mad at me for asking why he didn't, even though I had gotten him something, and he hung up on me while I was crying to play video games with his friends. On Christmas he didn't talk to me at all at his families house, who I had never met before, because I wore a crop top and he said ""why would you wear a crop top to a Christmas party."" He had even bought me the shirt I was wearing, and he didn't talk to me until his mom found out what happened and gave me her sweater to wear. Our relationship has just been really toxic for a long time and has had really negative effects on my life. 

On Saturday we barely talked all day, and when we did start talking I told him I needed space to figure out how I feel. He kept asking how I felt and I tried to explain, saying I just wasn't happy anymore and needed to figure things out. I told him I needed until my therapy appointment on Monday to figure it out. We still talked on Sunday and Monday, and he told me that on Saturday he had a terrible day because he has no friends at college and his mom didn't respond to his message about him feeling terrible. This obviously made me feel really bad, as I had told him I needed space on the same day that he was already upset, making things worse.

On Monday I had my therapy appointment, and eventually sent him a message saying that I couldn't do it anymore. I said the mean things he had said to me in the past had really gotten to me and I just couldn't do it. I said I was sorry for making him feel lonely but I just wasn't happy and that our relationship had become a really big point of stress in my life. Immediately following this, he told me he could change and that he had been doing research on how to work on his anger issues. I kept saying I can't I can't I can't, but he kept saying that he could change.

He asked if we could call and talk about it, and I said sure but I'm crying really hard so I probably won't be able to speak. When we called, he kept saying that he could change, and that he doesn't know why he didn't do it before when I brought up those issues. I said why wouldn't you try to change the first time I told you what you said hurt me? He said he doesn't know, but he will put 110% effort in to try to be better. He started crying and saying he loves me so much even if he doesn't show it, and that I'm all he looks forward to everyday and that he thinks about me in everything he does. He said that I'm the only person who's ever been so nice to him, and that I'm not only nice but I'm good at everything and that he doesn't want to lose me. He also said he doesn't want to give up the relationship because we've been dating for over a year and it would be ""a waste"" to not try to fix it. The whole time I was just laying there crying, because this had just made everything so much more confusing. He kept saying that he's changed before, such as him putting more effort into our relationship and complimenting me more often. I never said that I would give him another chance on the phone, I just kept saying that I don't know how I feel right now and I can't think straight because I'm lightheaded from crying so much. He was really emotional and I just felt so conflicted. He can probably change but I just can't do it anymore. Some of the things he said on the phone sounded genuine, but I still held a doubt behind them because some of it just didn't make sense. He couldn't explain why he didn't change when I told him the things he had said hurt me the first time, and only said ""well you only said that recently"", but I don't think I should have to tell him that being mean would hurt me... I said why would you even say mean things in the first place. He said he just ""doesn't think about it"" when he gets like that, and that just doesn't make sense. He said he won't go to therapy, just work on himself.

I just don't know how to approach this from here. I've tried so hard to tell him in the nicest ways possible that the things he has done and said hurt me, but it never went anywhere. The only thing he changed was the amount of effort he put into our relationship when we are long distance, which I appreciate, but I'm just not happy. Our relationship makes me so anxious and stressed sometimes and as much as I care about him, I just want it to me over. I'm just not happy anymore. I'm sure he can change, but I don't really want the relationship to get better. I tried to do that so many times before and I'm just tired, but it feels like no matter what I say to him to try to end it he finds a way around it.

relationship_advice,"My ex (F18) and me (M18) broke up over 2 months ago. During that process we’ve tried getting back with each other back and forth but nothing lasted longer than 2 weeks. I’m sure that was a mistake because it didn’t let us process our feelings and let us acknowledge the relationship. Fast forward to last Friday, I talked to my ex about a lot of issues I had in the relationship and how I thought they could’ve been handled better. I mentioned things such as her not stonewalling, ignoring me, blocking me, simply not wanting to respond to any issue or argument we would have. She took accountability for her actions and explains that our time away has led her to think realize what she’s done and the type of person she was with (referring to me) She asked me if I would be willing to go through the healing journey with her and eventually be official as she still finds me as the “respectful guy” and still wants to build a future with me. 

I told her “I don’t know, I can’t make a decision because of the trust issues you left me” on her end she’s threatened to leave me and break up with me before. I addressed this to her and she said she felt that way because I was giving her signs that I didn’t love her. The “signs” I was giving her was that she was telling me what she would appreciate but I didn’t feel like the love I was getting was being reciprocated. I wasn’t expecting her to go all out for me but I felt as if I was giving and giving and giving and all she would do is just take. I addressed the breakup soon after. She broke up with me the moment I said I felt pressured into having sex because I felt that was the only thing we would do. I felt that if I didn’t give in then she would be unhappy with me and I didn’t wanna lose her. I wanted to spend our time doing something like painting, watching a movie, doing an activity that wouldn’t end up in us having sex. That was missing in our relationship. 

We addressed this issue and many more. Eventually she addressed similar issues and for anything that I offended her, I took accountability and apologized. After. She was finished she asked me again if I would like to be with her and I have her the same response “I don’t know.” It’s not that my love for her is gone, it’s that I’m afraid she doesn’t want to change to be a better person. I can’t force her into changing, that’s entirely up to her. I would like her to improve her behavior whenever we handle arguments, give me space and have trust in me since that was also missing when we were together. 

I’m also afraid I might break out and hurt her. I still have feeling I’m letting out because I bottled them in for so long while in the relationship and would like to just let them out on my own. I still have anger, frustration, and sadness for the way I was treated and would not want to suddenly break out and take it out on her. I want to settle my emotions until I am no longer bothered by what happened to me and am willing to take the risk of starting over with her. I still have love for her and see her as the amazing human being she is but I’m just not ready as I’m scared of getting hurt and mistreated again. Does anyone have any advice?

relationship_advice,"Hi everyone, first time post and I don’t really know how to start it. I met my boyfriend online last year. We became really close really fast, I work from home so had lots of freedom to move things around and he injured his knee shortly after we started talking so had plenty of time off to spend with me while he recovered. He’s Swedish, I’m British. We were romantically involved at the end of last year (around autumn) and became official in January of this year. Since then, I started to visit him in Sweden almost every weekend. I think it’s 5 times in 7 weeks or something. But there are issues on my mind that I want to know if I’m overthinking. He’s always been super secretive about his life, but so open with his time. He can call me at any point in the day and we message each other constantly. We even sleep on call together. Every time I visit Sweden, we have to book and stay in a hotel because he doesn’t deem his house to be ‘safe enough’ for me. He’s been vague about it but he does have a criminal past which he thinks is unsafe for me to be around even though he’s out of it now. He’s had girlfriends before me literally live with him though, but he says he just cares more about my safety because it’s the first relationship he’s felt true love and happiness in. But he’s told me his name, but I’ve never seen it on any ID but I didn’t feel the need to check or anything until I’m noting this all down. I don’t know his address but he knows everything about me (I even have my live location always on). I don’t know much about his past at all. And a lot of the time I feel more like a secret than it being a private relationship like he says. He says he wanted time to make it ‘feel right’ to tell me everything but it feels like it’s never coming.. and I don’t want to push too hard. I know the immediate response would be ‘he has a girlfriend!’ but we literally see each other 24 hours a day when we aren’t together in person so it isn’t that. What should I do? I’ve tried not to force it out of him but today I had a breakdown and just cried about not feeling like I’m good enough to know about him. When we are together in person everything is PERFECT. It’s like nothing else matters and I’ve never been happier. There was however an instance where I woke up and he was checking his phone messages away from me (he said it was his mum). He’s trying to break away from his family and has received a lot of messages from his mum (he’s shown me a few very recently but refused to read any or show me any until that point). But he goes through all my social media and encourages me to delete things from my past.

relationship_advice,"In my first job this cute coworker paid for my meals when our team went out for lunch for over a month. I had to trick him to take the money back. He constantly talked about how xyz women said nice things about him. I didn't think too much of it or him. Just a cutie that needs his ego stroked ig.

As i spent more time with him I realised I liked him. However he tried acting oversmart with me in front of others. Plus he sorta gaslighted me when I complained about a boss bullying me. She was cruel to me in private and sugary sweet to me in public because he was friends with her. I made new friends both him and her hated that. If another guy gets me a gift he gets a nicer gift. If another guy gets me chocolates. He buys the same chocolate and offers it. This can be just brotherly concern cuz he never said anything.

Meantime the bullying got so bad that I quit. I joined a new place and he joined the same company soon after. Now when he called me for lunch I avoided him and went with a few friends on my team. He tried a lot but I didn't want to run into my bully who moved soon afted he did. I ran into him and chatted. When we parted he taunted me with my bullys name. And boy I snapped. Idk if I overreacted but I never went upto him and spoke after that and pretended to be busy when he came over to talk till he stopped. I just know he's gonna say something to get a reaction and it sucks that I like him despite that.

The bully left and he hangs out with other coworkers often and my heart kinda hurts. He shows up at the same joints I do and sits in the same place I previously sat. Since we first met he's active only on this obsolete social media site that I'm active on despite having accounts all over and I sometimes reply to the stuff he posts there but I stopped that because man this isn't helping me get over him. I end up anticipating what he'll post next.

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend I have been together for 3 years. Things have been going well, and definitely see each other being life long partners. He is a senior in college and was planning on staying here for grad school. I am a junior in college and am still going to be here for at least another year. We were planning on getting a dog together and finding a new, better suited place together for the dog, amongst other plans. 

However, things changed when he was unexpectedly not accepted and now is strongly considering moving several states away for work(full time position). I love him a lot and definitely see a strong future with him (marriage, family, careers, travel together, etc). No doubt I support him and his career and am not trying to convince him to stay…. Though long distance is just something I painfully do not want to do. Yet I also do not want to leave him either. 

The distance seems dreadful and something that I will struggle with. He very much does not see it being a problem, as he believes our relationship is strong and has an underlying expectation that if he does move away I will move with him after I graduate in a year. While I do think our relationship is strong and LDR for a year or more would be manageable, the thought makes me shutter, and I fear that feeling will not go away. 

What do I do to cope and get past the fears of us becoming distant, disconnected, or growing apart, as he will be beginning a “new life” and I will not. Or is the best move to just forget it all?

relationship_advice,"TL;DR: I moved away from my best friend to live with my boyfriend. we stopped texting after a while for no reason and now idk how to initiate contact again without it being awkward.


Backstory: we met at work and instantly became friends, we have a ton of things in common and bonded over the fact that we both hated our job (retail). 

Last year I moved an hour away to live with my boyfriend. I quit my retail job and got a new job that I like way better. 

We used to text/snapchat/FaceTime every day, anytime something happened in our lives we told the other one immediately.

We continued that after I moved away, but as soon as I got my new job she got weird. Anytime I told her about the job (that I got the interview, how the interview went and then that I got the job) she wasn't happy for me at all and just kind of gave me a lazy passive aggressive answer.

Maybe she thinks I'm happier now at my new (better) job than I was working retail shifts with her. Of course I like my new job way better but I still miss all my old coworkers and especially her because they made work fun and we made the best memories together. And I told her that all the time. 

But when her passive aggressiveness just didn't stop I kind of stopped replying to her. First it was just Snapchat and then she didn't reply to my other messages and then the conversation just died down. It wasn't an argument or someone leaving the other on read in the middle of a conversation. It just kind of stopped and then no one picked up the conversation again. 

And now I don't know how to initiate contact again without it being awkward. The mood was tense before we stopped texting so I feel like we should talk about it but I can't just send her a text saying ""hey sorry for not responding for four months, let's continue where we left off?""

relationship_advice,"Hello!  This is going to be long so I apologize but I think the context and history is necessary in order for anyone to really be able to help. 

I first met the man I'm currently dating (we can call him Tom) in college four years ago.  We sat next to each other in class and often debated heatedly in class, which was very fun. I felt like he was on the same level as me intellectually and we often gained new insight into our opposing perspectives through these debates. The following year when we took another class together, we chose to sit next to each other again and eventually had a conversation to confront the sexual tension because it was clear the was some. We learned we were both in committed relationships but things were rocky between he and his gf and I was in a happy open relationship.  We kind of flirting left things as, ""if we're both available in the future we could get a room sometime.""  So we shelved each other but remained friendly until the end of that semester when he graduated. We pretty much lost touch for about two years (aside from generic happy holidays texts I believe). Sometime between Tom graduating and us getting back in touch, I found out from a friend through the grapevine that he has two kids.  Didn't really matter to me because we weren't interested in each other at the time but that's how I found out. 

When we reconnected in 2020 I was newly single after breaking off my engagement to my ex (we can call him James, 49M), the guy I'd been seeing when we met. However for financial reasons I was still living with James while working part time and going to school.  He was also single, but because of his (clearly) toxic relationship's traumatic ending and recent layoffs from the pandemic, he was unemployed and forced to move in with his children's mother. We agreed neither was in a good place emotionally, financially or practically to want a relationship, but began sleeping together exclusively while also picking back up our friendship. Tom and I really got to know each other during this time and would talk about our hopes, fears, values, ambitions, etc. all of the things you share with only a close friend or partner. We talked nearly every day, sometimes long conversations that lasted hours. The sex was amazing. In the meantime, we worked on putting our lives back together. 

Even though we'd agreed to keep things casual between us, I naturally caught feelings and told him I wanted to date him romantically.  He said he still wasn't ready to be in a relationship again, citing the trust issues he was working through after constantlybeing cheated on (and cheating on) his ex), the fact that I lived  with my ex, the fact that he lived with his other ex, the mother of his children, and, his financial situation. These were all good reasons to not begin a new relationship of course, so I couldn't really fault him for how he felt and I was glad for his honesty.  We continued to sleep together despite my feelings for a while and occasionally I would broach the subject again only for him to still shut it down even after he found a job. He would say things like, ""if our situations were different I would love to date you"" but I began to feel like he was just saying that to placate me while maintaining our sexual relationship.  I grew resentful over time and went no contact with him  for about 6 months last year, blocking him on all apps. He texted me and was confused and hurt but basically told me to do what I had to do for my mental wellbeing when I offered to try and talk things through once more. 

After Tom and I cut off contact I became very depressed and began sleeping with James again.  I was not making enough money, was struggling with school due to attention span issues caused by long covid, and didn't know how to get my life back on track while still living with and depending financially on some respects on my ex-fiancé. I was very defeated. I knew that I was happier when I had Tom in my life, and was willing to maintain a strictly platonic relationship with him if he was down. We reconnected again at the end of last year.

When we reconnected, Tom had found full time employment and within a couple of weeks had helped me find a job with the same employer but at a different location. We have no overlap in roles and have never had reason to interact with each other at work. We were both making real money now. Tom expressed interest in starting up our friends with benefits arrangement up again but I shot it down several times. He even not-so-subtly tried to make me jealous by mentioning he'd rather be pleasuring me than the women he was sleeping with at the time lol. It didn't work, I'm not a jealous person and don't care who he's sleeping with if we haven't agreed to exclusivity. He complained that he wanted a long term partner to have sex with but no strings attached. I suggested he find a partner he wants to date but he responded that there were ""no benefits to dating right now.""

Then about two weeks later he broached the idea of us beginning to date exclusively. I agreed and so we are currently about four months into dating. We are both working a lot these days and so have been taking things slow. We live on opposite ends of a big city, so finding time to meet up, even on days of are difficult because he's also a father and I'm finishing up my last semester of school. I wish we could see each other more to continue building a relationship, but sadly money and the distance present unique obstacles for us. He got a car recently which has made things somewhat easier.

Because of all the times he rejected me in the past, I'm hesitant to take him at his word on this dating thing, and still have this same nagging fear that he's stringing me along to maintain access to sex. I want to believe that this just means he was genuine all those times when he said he would love to date me when our circumstances changed, but I feel so insecure and so unsure about his motives and have noticed myself shutting down around him instead of opening up because I'm scared of getting attached and letting myself fall for him again.  If you look at my post history, you'll see a post I made about a guy my sister dated who was a serial liar and cheater.  (Update on that story: she is now no-contact with the toxic ex and dating a kind, considerate man who she says treats her like a queen) After seeing everything she went through with her ex, though I've been disillusioned I guess with how far some men are willing to go in order to maintain access to sex.  

What I really need right now is some insight into this situation, either from people who have went through a similar situation of transitioning from fwb to a relationship or just from men and women who are better at understanding men's minds than I am.  Do you all think he's dealing honestly and respectfully with me?  If so, how can I begin bringing down those emotional walls with him so we can finally give the relationship a real shot?  How does my situation sound to a third party who's not involved? I also want to be understanding of what's reasonable to expect given our circumstances if anyone has advice on dating while poor and/or dating a man with kids.

relationship_advice,"(a short version is a the end)
My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years. 
He broke up with me 6 weeks ago, because he decided to go back to his family (we left our country). He also said that he isn't happy with me anymore. He doesn't want to do anything to make our relationship work, or even try anything. He purposely choose to grow distant from me (since January he barely spoke to me and dismissed/argued with me anytime and anyway I tried to support him. He never let me in). He now says I never really tried, but it isn't true. I felt humiliated/refused many times when he didn't let me in but I always stayed by his side. After he screamed at me 6 weeks ago I asked him if the reason why he couldn't look me in the face anymore is that he wanted to leave me and he said he didn't know. We cryed and talked for hours and when it was time for me to go he didn't let me, he said he wanted me to stay. The next morning we made love and was closed than ever since January. But the next day he closed himself again and after a week he texted me that he actually wanted to break up. Since then he never stopped to text me and to meet me. When we met we hugged, he sometimes kissed my forehead and didn't refuse if kissed his cheeks, when we text we talk about everything. When I try talking about us he gets defensive. At Easter he went to visit his family and will be back tomorrow.Saturday I had a meltdown and didn't answer his last text (he asked me if I could sleep that night). Since then I didn't hear from him. I wanted to surprise him at the airport, because for him it's always hard to leave his family and I wanted him to have someone waiting for him. But now I'm not sure. My heart says to go, my brain says that we don't speak since Saturday so I should leave it, also that I'm delusional and shouldn't do it since he doesn't care about me anyway. For me to go I need to take three trains. 
I don't know what to do.. I really want to see him, but I know that he doesn't care about me anymore... 

Long story short:
My bf broke up with me after 7 years. We never stopped to see or text eachother. He will be back tomorrow after visiting his family, I wanted to surprise him at the airport but I didn't answer his text since Saturday and I'm not sure I should go because he doesn't care about me anymore.",0,Should I (22f) go to the airport to meet my ex (25m),r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8863120,1682451396,0,1682451412,1682451412,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,12,463

relationship_advice,"So my gf and I are 24(F) and 26(M) been together for almost 4 years, probably gonna get married around 30 but we’re in no hurry.

My brother and her sister are both 20yo and lonely, and my brother’s told me he has a crush on her sister. 

Gf and I have so far taken the stance of “mind my own business” but I can’t help but feel like he’s got about 3.5 billion other women potentially available to him that would never end in a super awkward relationship dynamic, as opposed to his intentions of dating her sister. (Idk if she’s into him as well, figured it’s not my place to insert myself and ask)

Personally I think he’s just being lazy and going for whatever attractive woman happens to be in his immediate orbit, because he claims he can’t find a girl in his regular life (20yo and is an HVAC apprentice and Muy Thai student, not many girls in his social world) but I think he’s just lazily thinking with his dick and going after her because she’s cute and nearby.

Any advice on what to say/do? I’d just hate for them to end up having sex, eventually breaking up and then it be awkward at every family function for everybody around, as I think it would be at some point

relationship_advice,"I hate that my bf watches porn and it makes me feel not enough

I came here because I needed some uplifting. I’m so unhappy that my bf watches porn and I even have communicated many times that it feels like cheating. I send him so much content of me and in person I don’t feel not good enough because he compliments me a lot and makes me feel loved.

Im struggling with the fact that even though I’ve sent a huge amount of pics and videos he still isn’t satisfied where he can’t use those and he turned to random girls online. It’s constantly something I’m worried about and I have significant trauma in my past of multiple guys forcibly touching me to porn while I was unable to move, as well as porn being used against me because of comparison with exes in which I was told that he didn’t find me sexually attractive anymore. My current bf says he is trying to stop but because he was exposed to that so young he seems to have a dependency on it or perhaps he has a porn addiction. One time when I was over he opened Reddit on his phone and it was some girls nude and since then this topic haunts me everyday.

relationship_advice,"So my girlfriend and I haven’t been able to spend as much time together as her mother has been in town for like 4 weeks, but she just dropped her off this morning at the airport. So she came over to my place as I was finishing up work. 

We always play fight and wrestle and I was kissing her cheeks and then decided to give one a bite/nibble. She reacts by slapping me full force across the forehead and her fingernail hits my right eye and all of a sudden “rainbows” took over my vision in that eye.

I was freaking out for a solid minute while she apologized profusely and kept telling me how it was an accident. I know it was an accident. I have 0 doubts she did this maliciously, but I wanted to have a serious talk about how slapping in the face is not even remotely okay. She responds by apologizing profusely again. However, what I ask is for her to promise to never do this again, which for some reason she needed a time to think about. She was wording it like “i promise to never accidentally…” so I cut her off immediately and now its been a 30 minute argument.

She keeps citing how she’s tired from work, and dropping her mom off, and everything. All I was focusing on was asking for my girlfriend to never hit me in the face again.

relationship_advice,"So to make a long story short, me and my partner have this friend we met at a concert. We'll call them Crow, I'm not sure how old they are. I think around the same age as my partner.   Crow is a musician that me and my partner both thoroughly enjoy, but didn't think we'd ever be friends with. After the show we saw them at, I added them on Facebook and they added me back and eventually me and crow started talking. My partner eventually followed suite and we all started talking, this went off an on for a while now and eventually it turned into Crow (with asking permission) if they could flirt with me, then eventually my partner. We both agreed and boundaries were respected at all times up until today. 

I was having some pretty bad dreams (unrelated) and had a hard time staying asleep this morning, ontop of that my partners iPad kept going off with messenger notifications - I went to see what the fuss was about and saw extremely lewd messages from crow to my partner. I was in shock, because the agreement is that we would both be included in any kind of... Activity like that so no one felt left out. I immediately felt betrayed, hurt and left out. 

I had noticed earlier my partner texted me and said their usual good morning text and had asked if I could message crow if we could meet up with them at their show tomorrow (they are touring right now and playing in our city and said a while back they wanted to see us) because they were nervous. 

I said something along the lines of it looks like they've already been texting you, I've seen the messages and all I got was a reply of ""soon"" from a message I sent to them (crow) from the night before and that I felt betrayed and left out. 

My partner did apologize and put a stop to it, but I'm still hurt, crow did message me and gave me basically a have assed apologize of which I didn't respond to. 

I really don't want to be around my partner now and especially crow and I'm considering not going to the show tomorrow because of the boundaries they broke - bc up until this point, crow has been big on respecting boundaries and asking for consent, as well as making us both feel included. Not to mention, I feel less desired bc the type of messages I got from crow were never that lewd - so I also feel they crave my partner over me, despite making it seem otherwise, so now I'm wondering if they claimed to want/like me as leverage to get with my partner.",0,My (33NB) partner (28nb) didn't consider my feelings or involvement,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,0.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8863025,1682450191,0,1682450211,1682450211,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,10,462

I am wondering if I can get a general consensus on if this is normal and general advice on what to do. She (F27) and I (M29) have been dating for two years. 

I have made it known early on that it makes me uncomfortable and that I don’t want them in my life. 

She thought it would fade in time. It has not. He messaged her the other day on my birthday trip about the cat they shared. Nickname and all. And has a close relationship with their family and her father. He was in her house (she hasn’t moved out). He also gave her parents a painting of the cat for Christmas from a painting that his ex girlfriend painted for them … 

I’m not comfortable with any of this but she says it’s normal and stipulated that her therapist says it’s normal. They dated for 4+ years. 

I’m at a lost and want to know if this is normal.. I also have driven it home that I am not comfortable with this. It has led to huge arguments.

relationship_advice,"Yes I know I shouldn’t but I do, I don’t do it very often though. We have a good relationship, I’m happy with him but I have my own insecurities and baggage that drags me down this pathway. We have been together for a year now.

So to get through some context, he has a very specific type and I fall under that type. Depending on the person and the way you see it, this “type” could be a fetish. Basically I’m Asian and he’s mixed  (half white, half Asian) and I know he finds Asian women very attractive, he doesn’t wave it around in my face but I’m very conscious of that.

Him and his boys always used to share porn, photos and Instagram accounts of hot Asian chicks, he did tell me his friends do this and that he did when he was single but it has stopped, I know that he doesn’t them send anymore, but I know his friends and what they’re like and how they speak about women when it’s just the boys. I’ve also previously found a private photo album of nude photos and videos of his ex on his phone (who he broke up with 3 years ago) had a big argument over that but it was all sorted and we were fine, this was about 3 months ago. I’ve also seen his porn history and it’s all Asian porn, but I wasn’t that bothered by it because sometimes a man just needs to rub one out. Although it does irk me. 

The issue starts here. We just moved in with each other start of March and everything has been great, no major issues, we have really done well in building a home and adjusting to eachother but our schedules are completely opposite. He works 9am-5pm Monday to Friday and I am at uni Monday Tuesday till 5pm and then work till 12am at a bar Thursday to Sunday. I am always studying or at work and our sex life has dwindled since moving in, we’ve only had sex a hand full of times because I’ve just been too busy, but previously our sex life was great. We had our 1 year anniversary two weeks ago and we planned to have a little sexy time but I had one too many drinks at dinner and then went home and passed out to sleep. When I woke up I could tell he was frustrated and upset that I slept after our anniversary dinner and we didn’t have sex. I did feel really bad and i know to him it’s not all about the sex but if I could have atleast woken up to watch a movie with him… we did agree not to do anything big for our anniversary because we had just moved in and spent so much money already, so the least I could have done was spend some time with him. Anyways this wasn’t a big issue and there was no argument or disagreement between us, we both understood how crazy life has been now, but we only had sex once since then. Last night he made a comment on how we used to have sex all the time, like 3-4 times in a day. I didn’t think anything of it, he has tried to be affectionate with me but it’s not anything that has given me the idea that he’s trying to initiate some sexy time. I checked his phone tonight and his history caught my eye, I usually don’t care about seeing porn on his phone because he’s even admitted to me to watching porn, but we were both home today and yesterday due to public holiday and when I wanted him to get up to spend some time with me and eat lunch he was actually watching porn and having a wank, when he said he was so tired and going back to bed, he was watching porn. But then I kept scrolling and every single day since our anniversary he’s watched porn and always Asian porn. And to top it off, 2 days after our anniversary he searched up an old flame’s only fans account. He likes to watch only fans content because it’s more realistic apparently and watches it using some random forum. He’s told me about this girl before, they never dated or anything but we’re sleeping with eachother for a while and I know that it’s a conquest that he’s proud of so it just makes me sick to my stomach to know that he searched her up and not just searched but went through a few of her videos. 

I just feel like with all the past things I’ve found, he’s got some weird addiction to porn or just past girls. I don’t know, I really don’t know what this is or if I’m being delusional but I just know I don’t feel very good.

relationship_advice,"So we met organically (not through an app) about 2 weeks ago. We've hung out 3 times and each time it was like time flew by. There's so much chemistry between us, we get along really well and like a lot of the same things. He's really a gentleman and compliments every part of me which i really enjoy. He's a very gentle person from what I can tell, and he's very clear on everything he says. We both decided we don't want to have sex anytime soon because of past experiences. Hes a very kind and helpful person too
He told me he's a mentor in AA and was very open to answer any questions i had and was completely open about it. Which i really liked.

Now here's where I need advice. In order from least pressing to most. I need to know if you were in this position would you move forward?
I really like all the above qualities he has and he has a really nice face and eyes but I'm not super attracted to his body. It feels shallow but that's important right?
Recently, i also discovered he's a smoker. That's been a major turn off for me in the past. But he tells me he doesn't smoke on days he knows he's gonna be hanging out with someone. And so far i hadn't been able to smell cigarette on him so i believe that.
Then last night we were kissing and feeling. He paused and looked at me smiling but there was nervousness behind it. it was clear he wanted to say something so i gave him time. When he felt comfortable he told me the reason he wanted to hold off on sex was because he has herpes but since he got it he's learned how to manage it. He told me he'd answer any and all questions. he did and didn't make me feel stupid when i had dumb questions.

So now I am torn because we get along so well and i like him as a person and all the chemistry we have but those other things really bother me and idk how i should feel about them.

relationship_advice,"i could probably write an entire book about this situation, and it has caused me enough emotional distress over the years to seek therapy, but i will keep it as succinct as possible.

i have actively spent the last 4 years trying to caution my best friend that the man she is seeing is manipulative, predatory and an all around horrible person. despite my efforts, she has continued to see him, at one point became pregnant by him, and recently informed me that he physically assaulted her, confirming that my worst fears had actualized.

my efforts in attempting to encourage her to break things off from him over the years has unquestionably been consistent, intense and diverse. i have offered her my home and fiancé’s sister’s home as physical places of refuge, offered countless hours of advice, support and encouragement, offered to intervene directly, suggested a restraining order, suggested she invest in self defense tools, attempted to be a mediator, offered my fiancé up as a physical presence if things turned violent, offered her support when she found out that she was pregnant, the list goes on. she has enforced none of these measures and maintained open communication channels with this dude the entire time. 

for those that may speculate that she is helpless and her hand is being forced, i can absolutely GUARANTEE you that there are ample measures she is consciously choosing not to take; even with assurances of safety and backup.

in the first few years of our friendship, she essentially gave all of my support a brazen middle finger and told me that i was being controlling. we fell out for almost a year over it and she dated and moved in with him.

recently, after she told me that he had physically assaulted her and that he had also assaulted a past partner, she seemed more cognizant of and remorseful for her choices and their emotional affect on me than she has ever been, apologizing profusely to me and acknowledging that “she should have listened”.

to cut to the chase, for the last month or so, i have been fairly confident that they were done for good. she has presented to me that she is no longer in contact with him, fully moved out and had no intentions of seeing him again. i have recently found out from multiple mutual friends and friends of the man in question that this is false.

honestly, i am f*cking drained. i am clearly extremely concerned for her safety, and have been since day one, but i feel like the only person advocating for it. she continues to CHOOSE to go back to this person against the advice of pretty much everybody in her life. i am the last person standing that is continuing to try to put an end to this, and it seems my efforts are futile.

do i try to talk to this guy myself? do i call her mother? do i involve some muscle? do i take a hiatus from the friendship? not being friends with her is not an option because she is essentially my sister. i am the closest friend she has, and vice versa. this situation is not about me - her safety is the chief concern - but i can’t keep jumping through my own ass to save someone that doesn’t want to save themselves.",0,"i sense that my (26F) best friend (29F) is continuing to secretly see a man that physically assaulted her and sexually assaulted a past partner, despite 4 years of my pleas. i am at a complete loss.",r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,0.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8862943,1682449236,0,1682449254,1682449254,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,37,564

relationship_advice,"Bf (28) won't let me in his house (I'm 29)

We've been dating a year and a half, almost exactly now. I do love him, but I've been feeling like I'm accepting things I shouldn't. I feel like I really need some advice.  

 When he had car issues and didn't end up having a car for a little bit, I would drop him off and he would have me drop him at the complete opposite side of the complex then he stays in so that I wouldn't see where his apartment is and he would wait till I drove away before going to his apartment. it's that serious for him. 

He says it's because of a lot of reasons. 
1. Told me that he's traumatized by a past experience where an ex hurt him physically (which, as someone who's experienced some of this, I can empathize.) 

2. He wants to do it when he's ready to

3. He wants it to be beautiful in there and make it nicer before I come over (I've expressed that isn't as important to me as it is to him) 

4. He's broken up with a woman ( In the last relationship before we got together) for giving an ultimatum about this. 

5. Said it's not safe for a weird reason he wouldn't  really say why, the reasons change when he does vaguely mention them

6. Says he doesn't even let his family In his house, etc.

And yet, he spend every day I'm home at my house. I know this is because I let him and love him, but he doesn't seem to understand why this is an issue. 

This is the house issue.....there's more below 

My boyfriend and I have had a few other issues which I'll detail below, but the biggest one (and one I couldn't imagine myself allowing when we first started dating) is that my boyfriend will not let me in his apartment, or even know his apartment I've been asking and asking him to not go through my phone, because not that there's anything to hide, but he gets really intense about it and it's almost like he can't stop once he starts. He's gotten slightly better, but it's really only for a few weeks then he gets anxious and it starts happening again. 

He gets very jealous- overthinking and I try so hard to be patient and understanding, but it's never enough and he'll ask repeatedly if I'm cheating no matter how many times I answer. I've had to tell him I'm gonna answer once and that's it because it drives me crazy. 

He wants to spend all the time together, which yes I do want to see him, but I'm someone who has a job and a small business I'm trying to build up with my friends, and there isn't a whole lot of time to begin with. I'm pretty independent too so I need time alone also. So most of the time we spend together is during the week or end of the weekend. He gets understandably frustrated and I make time for weekend dates when I can, but also just feel like it's never enough time for him, so I feel like I can never make time for myself. 

He's very hot and cold, one minute saying he wants me to take time for me and take care of myself, but then he sort of loses it when I say I'm gonna take that time when I do get overwhelmed. He'll say things like, can't you do this one thing for me etc. Saying anytime it's about his feelings it doesn't matter, when I am just saying I need me time. 

He'll video call me anytime I'm doing anything without him if he is anxious, and want me to show him where I am etc. I tell him I won't deal with this, and refuse and he'll beg saying why can't I just do this one thing if it makes him feel better. I explain how it makes me feel and it's like it doesn't matter. 

 I don't like that behavior or having to prove things and the house thing coupled with the massive distrust, being jealous of my friends and family time, it really doesn't feel good. 

I would like some advice or perspective, I feel like there's nothing I can do to ever make this better  And we've had talks where he says he understands but it always ends up with the same behavior

, and  All of this has made me feel like I'm losing myself, and that I'm so anxious about all of this that it's very hard to function and maintain my life. 

I'm not sure what to do or how to do it I feel Like I've put a lot of time into trying to understanding trying to be there for him But also that may be I've accepted way too much of thisand that's why I feel like I'm drowning in this relationship.

I feel like he wants to  know everything about my life all the time and doesn't extend me the same courtesy where it matters and it's making me feel like I don't know what's going on",0,28m bf won't let me (29f) in his house &amp; more,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8862918,1682449041,0,1682449060,1682449061,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,11,872
relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 7 months. He invited me to a friend's holiday party. At the party I met ""Sarah"". I got vibes that she was into my boyfriend because she was showing him a lot of attention and laughing at all his jokes, but wasn't showing anyone else that much attention. He wasn't showing her any attention back so I didn't think much of it. 

Then she organized a weekly 6 am rock climbing meetup with him and, initially, two other girls. However, the two other girls don't come. It is just them two meeting up every week and climbing for a few hours. 

The other day, there was supposed to be a group of people going to watch a movie together, but it turned out just to be the two of them. I didn't go because I was busy and don't like that genre of movies.

I feel jealous by the amount of time they spend together and I get vibes she likes him. I'm afraid she is trying to steal my boyfriend. I am afraid he might leave me for her because we don't have any common hobbies. She is a very beautiful, intelligent, successful woman. 

My boyfriend is very loving and has never given me a reason to question his feelings for me, but my sister had two boyfriends poached from her, so I know it is possible. 

I don't want to be controlling or jealous, but I also don't want to lose my boyfriend because I really love him. Also, I might lose my boyfriend if I come off as too controlling by asking them to stop hanging out one on one with her.

relationship_advice,"I am in a relationship with my boyfriend of a few months. Almost right away I discovered that we have differing values. At first I told myself that it would be fine, but now I’m not so sure.

Firstly, my boyfriend is religious, catholic, and I am not. With this comes more conservative leaning views. For example he is pro-life. I on the other hand am pro-choice. When we had the abortion conversation, he ended it with “let’s just never talk about this again”. But these topics are hard to ignore. Sometimes he makes a one-off comment about a subject that makes me question what I’m doing here.

He also lives on a farm on very secluded land, and wishes for me to live there with him in the future. The thought of being secluded for the rest of my life is very frightening, but he would never leave. 

But, there’s always a but. He treats me so well and is giving me everything I’ve ever wanted and more. I’m talking breakfast in bed every weekend, massages, sweet notes/letters, listens to me rant/complain for hours. I have been in 2 other long term relationships and I almost feel as if no one has loved me before, because I can feel his love for me so strong. I am scared to make a wrong choice and lose this. 

Because of my past relationships I am having a hard time distinguishing attachment from love here and cannot tell how I feel. He talks about wanting to marry me and have kids with me, but thinking about our moral differences makes me wary. 

Can a relationship with differences such as these work? Should I even try to make it work?

relationship_advice,"Apologies in advace if my english is not great, I'm not a native speaker.
My bf and I have been dating for little over 2 years and we've lived together for around 1 year and a half but we've known each other (and been Friends) for over 10 years
I love him very much and I find most of his qualities great: he's the most intelligent guy I've ever met, he's patient and supportive, we are compatible regarding our likes, values, ideas, and future plans.
It all looks great, the only issue we have is regarding some insecurities that I've developed over time related to him keeping in touch with his ex-girlfriends (or people he usted to flirt with).
 Normally this wouldn't be something that causes an issue for me, but some years prior to dating him I received an ig follower request from an account that seemed weird to me since I didn't know the person, so I proceed to check who else this odd account was following and I was surprised to find out most of his female Friends and exes (that I've known of, since he told me about them while telling me about his past in a casual talk) were there and inappropiate pictures were posted there in this account stories. Naturally I was pissed and blocked the account and I thought he was the one behind this ig account.
When we started dating I raised this issue to him, after that, he apologized and told me he did it because he felt frustrated with my prior rejection to him some years earlier. I told him I agreed to forgive him.
We also had a separate conversation where I told him that I don't care of his past, as soon as it doesnt interfere in our present life together, as I wanted to make sure to explicitly state My limits and what I'm not confortable with in a relationship, and he agreed.
Some time after this, he started to talk about  topics I knew where not appropiate of him , after that I found out he was interacting with his most recent ex-gf account, which made me really mad and insecure at that time (since I thought I clearly started My limits to him). We had an argument from this where at first he was sorry but then he started saying I was not clear on My terms and to interact with his ex account didn't seem to him as interfering with the present. After this argument he stopped following all of his exes and people who he used to flirt with (I never asked him this,  I'm not confortable with asking My couple what o what not to do) and we agreed any of us would do this, which I don't mind since I'm the type of person who distances with ex-couples for mental Health.
Fast forward some months later and we are living together, I found out that he started following an ex gf account and also he follows a ton of ig models, which caused the biggest arguments we had. After those arguments, he decided to stop having ig so we can avoid having issues, I was not happy with that as I would be happier if he understood My insecurities and Made compromises into changing his behaviour not deleting his account and limiting his Freedom.
Present day, we are in a good shape, he reinstaled his ig and everything seemed Nice to me, however, I found out that he again followed people who he used to flirt with. Perhaps I'm being insecure again and I should only trust him, however, this really hurts me and I'm not sure if I should discuss this with him or just deal with this on my own (with therapy couseling).
Also, perhaps I'm afraid since we've applied to several Masters together and he has talked to me seriously about proposing. Besides this, he's a great guy, since I date him I landed a better job, he really helps me and takes good care of me

relationship_advice,"I (25m) met a guy (20m) off of tinder a couple months ago. Started talking a bit and we exchanged instas. I live fairly far from him but I am down in his area just about every other weekend and he knows about this. We actually went to the same sporting event randomly but we not able to meet that time. After that missed connection I suggested we go out on a date and it went really well. The date consisted of mini golf then I surprised him with indoor go-cart racing afterwards. We ended up talking until 2:30 in the morning and made out pretty heavily, but I kinda ended it there since I made it clear earlier in the date that I wanted to take things a bit slower since I really liked him. I mentioned to him that I was not experienced on our first date and he said that he did not care at all. We both had clear intentions and made plans for a second date. We exchanged numbers immediately after walking him to his car and then he asked for a goodbye kiss which I obliged, when he got home he texted me and said he really enjoyed the date and had a really fun time. We texted pretty heavily for around two weeks while I was back at my place. It seemed like there was genuine interest between the both of us. I came into town a bit early to celebrate the holidays and we made last minute plans to hang out, but family came in the way for him and he flaked. I hit him up later in the week to make sure we were still on for the original date and he gave a good reason for having to cancel it. He then said that he wanted to get to know me better and do smaller things instead of the larger date I had planned out. I suggested an alternative for that weekend along those lines and he ended up ghosting me. 

I gave him some space and messaged him a week later asking if everything was alright since our communication had some to a stand still. I included that I realized that I came off too strong in my messages and would stop texting him as much, but that I was still interested in him, and asked if he was more comfortable just being friends.

He responded very quickly apologizing for being distant and said that he realized that he was not looking for anything serious and he felt like he was not ready for a relationship, but would still like to be friends. I responded with cool and to hit me up if he wanted to hang out or just talk. He still looks at all of my insta and snap stories. I have not received any further contact from him after a week and I have not messaged him either. 

In my mind I think he just became extremely avoidant because he felt really bad he missed multiple plans. He gave alternatives but nothing that was concrete in a time or place. Both of the subsequent plans we made after our first date he said he was really looking forward to seeing me again and that he was really excited. Him ghosting until I confronted him really threw me off but I understand how people's mindsets can change. 

I think I have a mindset shift as well. Even though the prospect of a relationship is really enticing, the high and low feelings that came with it were too much. I still kind of want a relationship, but I am definitely open to get a FWB type of situation. When would the appropriate time be to suggest the topic of FWB or is that even a good idea given the circumstances? Am I reading into this too much and is this just his way of saying he's not interested anymore, especially since we only went on one actual date? 

I brought this up with a very close friend and she recommended that I play it cool as not to come off desperate and just let him reach out to me. Is this the best way to handle the situation? He knows my location on snap and has said previously he's looked for me. His birthday is in a couple weeks so I think that may be a decent time to just casually message him if I want to initiate contact since I will be in the area. 

How should I approach this?

TLDR: Great first date, planed for another date, lot of texting in between, mutual interest, he flaked with good reasons, ghosted me, said he was not ready for something serious but still wanted to be friends, I said cool hit me up whenever, been a week, what should I do?",0,How should I (25m) continue with this guy (20m) I am seeing?,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8862878,1682448538,0,1682448552,1682448553,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,12,813

relationship_advice,"English is not my first language so pls don't judge me ;-;

I 21F got a message from a boy, we'll call him L, 25 M. 

I was bored and since I'm working in the networking business why not get to know each other for business etc.

He told me he is single and is looking for a GF. I told him im preferring to be single right now.
He still wanted to keep in touch and we started chatting more and eventually i gave him my number. 

He also got more interested in my business so the rest is history. He called me after a couple of days texting on the phone and admitted that he is interested in me and would do anything to meet me. I told him, i don't know since I wanted to be extra cautious.


Fast forward I was absent from my socials for about a month bc of private reasons. I came back to all the snaps he sent me over the period. I remember when he was begging for my snap and I repeatedly told him I'm not active on it. I gave up and he was added on my friends list. I decided to snap him back since I was out and I thought why not give it a chance. 

To my shock...his Girlfriend sent me a snap of herself back. 

My jaw dropped. I again made a snap asking who she was. 

Her response: ""his gf"". I wanted throw up.

She asked me who i was and I replied with ""It was a snap for my friends list so everyone got it"". 

I asked her how long they've been dating.

""About half a year now"" my heart stopped.
I couldn't believe my eyes. This poor girl.

I asked for her socials and she gave me her Snapchat. I'm pretty sure that L found out about everything be since then I stopped receiving messages and snaps.

It hurt me a bit but it's nothing compared to the betrayal towards the girl

relationship_advice,"My boyfriend (24M) and I (24F) have been together for three years. In that time, we’ve met most of each others’ families. He doesn’t like quite a few of my family members, mostly my father and brother because of how they treat me, and refuses to be around them. I understand where he’s coming from, and though it makes me sad I try not to push it. It doesn’t often become an issue, because most of my family lives in a different state. I’m a much more family oriented person than he is, though, so I try to make plans with my family whenever possible. 

We hang out with his cousins pretty often, and are close to them. I have an older cousin who I would love to be closer with, as we grew up together and she’s the only family member I have in my city.

I was fine with that, and went by myself. 

Today she texted me and invited the both of us to her birthday party again tomorrow. They’ve never met, so I was very excited to tell my boyfriend. He said that he doesn’t remember what was said, but she said something last year that made him uncomfortable so he doesn’t want to go again this year. I was confused because they’ve never met, she never said anything about him to me, and as far as I remember he didn’t go last year because of our argument. I told him it was really important to me that he met her, and I think he’s misremembering what happened. He says that he knows she said something that made him uncomfortable, even if he doesn’t remember what, when, or how, and that I’m dismissing his feelings. I feel the same way. Am I dismissing his feelings because I think he’s misremembering?

My [32/F] bf [31/M] of 7 months is always distant after we have sex. Not exactly right after sex, we cuddle and laugh together which usually he initiates. 

But the next morning he is usually distant and feels like his depressed. Doesn’t talk doesn’t like to be touched. We don’t live together so when he leaves he rarely text or call would reply but take hours and give single word replies. But if I don’t text him he says I’m being cold and I don’t care, but my attempts are rarely reciprocated once he leaves. 

He usually is very present we spend lot of time together, cook go for movies and he plans dates, but every time after we have sex I feel like I don’t matter to him anymore or his not attracted to me anymore. I have asked him before about this and he said he was just busy which I don’t believe at all since other days he acts differently. 

This behaviour has been so confusing and frustrating. Am I overthinking this? Is there something I can do about it? Or just ignore?

relationship_advice,"So I (18F) really want to move to California. I won’t disclose where I currently live but it’s in the south, which I hate, because the state I live in has the worst policies ever. My boyfriend lives in Texas. Which is, objectively, even worse than where I live. He really wants me to move there to be with him, which was my original plan. But I don’t think I could live there for two years. I also want to go to a good university, and where Id go if I moved to my boyfriend is not that great. It’s ok but not as good as the university Im looking at in California. Also California is my dream state to live in. I’m afraid he only got together with me because he thought I was going to move there, and not because he really loved me and was willing to go through the hardships of a long distance relationship.

relationship_advice,"So she's a fantastic cleaning lady and super hardworking. But she's too familiar with me and it makes me slightly uncomfortable. For example, she hugs me when she's leaving, which I already don't like. Today she even kissed me (completely platonically - I'm a woman too) on the head!

We both speak a language that has the familiar 'you' and the formal 'you plural'. Like Tu and Vous in French. I always address her formally cause she's older than me, and it feels appropriate, plus she's a stranger to me. She never does, fine, but even uses familiar pet names like 'Sunshine' and the diminutive form of my first name. I can live with that but the hugs....

We are from similar cultures (Neighbouring Eastern European countries) but I'm much more Westernized. She's also older. Ultimately I think it's a personality difference though.

I would feel so rude saying something direct!

relationship_advice,"I’m currently in a long distant relationship with a guy who stays 1hr and 30 mins away from me. We only been dating for officially 7 months now. In the beginning of the relationship, I would go visit this man almost twice a week on my off days. Everything was okay until random people from his neighborhood would pass by his house and stop by. My bf will stand there and have a 2hr conversation with this men as if I’m not there. This caused me to stop talking to him. About a month later, he reach out to me, so we tried again. As time passed, I started question if this man was even attracted to me because no matter how much I would flirt with him or feed him many compliments, or even have sex with me. He would either not acknowledge what I said or complain that I’m not all that into him. Mind you, I’m the only on this relationship who’s been traveling the distance to see the other. He had a car in the beginning of the relationship, but would never come and see me. Hell, he didn’t even want to use his car when I was with him, no matter how short the distance was. Not only that, but there were times where I bought him $700 worth of groceries twice. Whenever I would try to tell that it would be better if we just stay as good friends, he would, “You wouldn’t be saying that if we was having sex.” There have been many times where I would try and have a sit down talk with him, but instead of him actually listening, he gives a lecture. Example: I would ask him if he was even attracted to him anymore and he would answer with,”Do you know the difference between to Love and Lust?” And give me a whole “lecture”. When I would question him more, he would get even more frustrated.

She's been upset with me before for not trusting her and says that it hurts her and that made me feel terrible. I started trusting her and lastnight I was at her place and we were having a really good time and laughing and everything. She fell asleep and I should not have done this but I snooped through her phone. I found 2 flirty messages, one from when we first started talking, and one from about 1-2 weeks before we started dating. The one close to us dating was that She posted a story of a bathroom carving that said e+b in a bathroom her name starts with a b and his name starts with an e). The carving was unrelated to them and he swiped up on her story and said ""us?"" And she responded with ""yea duh"". But the message before was much more flirty and he was talking about licking gravy off of her and she was into it. What really bothers me is that she still has contact with someone she knows is interested in her and I'm not okay with that. I confronted her and she was apologetic and said that it was a joke and was telling me she'd never cheat on me and she's not gonna lose me and that she's going to fix this. This morning she said she was upset that I still don't trust her because I snooped her phone and it made me feel awful and like I'm in the wrong. Am I?

relationship_advice,"Hello reddit, I'm a first time poster on this sub, because I never in a million years thought that I would have to post here... But I am at a total loss of what to do.

I'll try to keep this short, but there's a lot of important details.

I (21F) and my girlfriend (22F) have been together 2 years. She is the light of my life. I love her so much. She is the sweetest, kindest soul I've ever met. She doesn't have a bad bone in her body.

My girlfriend goes to a University 2 hours away from mine, so since he beginning of our relationship it's been longish distance. It was never a big deal, one of us would come up every weekend. We'd come on Thursday or Friday after class, then stay till Monday so we saw each other literally half the time. And we called twice a day (once in the morning and once at night) and texted constantly! On the weekends, we'd always go out on a date.

But this semester she wrote a thesis, which is a HUGE amount of work, I get it, but it took up 100% of her time. There was literally no time for me. She didn't come up for almost 2 months, and wouldn't let me come down because she was too busy. Okay, I get it, it's temporary. But we wouldn't even talk! She never texted, never called, there were no more sweet gestures. When we did talk it, was ALWAYS about her thesis or how stressed her was, which I supported her in, but I never told her about my life or stressors because there was never time. But I thought,"" it's okay, it's temporary"". But her thesis has been over for almost 3 weeks, and nothing has changed.

During this time, I told her during the thesis that I understood she was stressed, but that she couldn't just not talk to me for days on end the next time she was stressed, and she agreed, but the same thing is happening.

She's moving to my city this month (!!!) but we are in a total housing crisis where we live right now, so finding a place is awful. Her lease is up in 5 days and she only managed to find a horribly small studio for way too much money. So we haven't seen each other in a while, because she's packing and apartment hunting with her mom.

The same this is happening. We haven't seen each other in weeks. She doesn't call or text. When we do talk, it's only ever about the apartment. She hung up on me mid-sentance the other day when I was telling her about my night, and hasn't called back since.

I know this is just a rough patch, but it feels never ending. I feel like I've been single for the last 5 months. I've tried telling her how unhappy I am, how I feel ignored, how I feel like her lowest priority, how something needs to change because I can't keep doing this, but she doesn't seem to get it.

I feel like I'm losing love every day. I feel like I am grieving a relationship that I am still in.

The worst part is, I can't believe a single thing she says. There is NO follow through anymore.

She says she's going to get me Starbucks, she forgets. She says she's going to get me flowers, she forgets. She says we're going to go out on a date tonight, we don't end up going. She says 'she'll call me right back!' and doesn't call me for 3 days. She says she'll text me more, she doesn't. She says she'll do better and to just 'wait it out a little longer' and nothing changes.

I am at a point where I don't believe a single word she says. Her words mean nothing.

I have told her so many times how I feel like I am single, how I feel like I don't have a girlfriend. I've been breaking down more and more to her saying that I can't keep doing this, and she keeps brushing it off. I feel like I can see the finish line, but I have nothing more to give to push myself over the line.

I don't want to break up. I love her so much, but I feel like I just need a break. I feel like it wouldn't be a big change at all, we don't see each other, she doesn't talk to me, we don't go out on dates. How would a little more space be any different? But I know that if I asked her for one, it would break her heart.

How do I make her understand?

relationship_advice,"I - 25 f - have been dating my current partner - 26 m - for 4 months now. I leave tomorrow to fly out to visit him (we are currently LD as he lives in our home state to be with his mom) and during my time there we’ll be staying at a hotel. For the last remaining days I’m there, my boyfriend wants to stay at a slightly nicer hotel to have a few “fancier” nights that I’m in town. Now the thought of that sounds absolutely lovely, but he’s wanting to split the cost of the hotel we’ll be staying at the last 3 days of my visit. Now, normally I would NEVER have an issue with that as I’m all for 50/50 in a relationship. But that is going to take up everything I have saved as spending money for my trip. And even then, I’d still be about $200 short for my half…when talking to my boyfriend about this, he asked me if that would be okay for me financially and me not wanting to disappoint him, I said yes but instantly knew I was going to be financially fucked from this. I’m afraid to bring it up to him and I wouldn’t even know how to address it. Originally the we had planned on staying at one hotel for the trip and I would just need to save up money for spending when we go out etc.  He works a higher paying job and is full time as to where I have the title of a “full time” employee, I have to constantly pick up shifts and bust my ass to get anywhere even close to 30/35 hours a week. He knows this and has never made me feel bad for my financial status and how strapped I can be sometimes. But at this point I feel like I’ve failed and disappointed him to be able to do my equal share of this relationship.

relationship_advice,"TLDR: My gfs best friend is actively sabotaging her other friendships and our relationship by lying to my gf about things and trying to make her feel more anxious herself, and I don't know how to talk to her about it. 

To save time, refer to my gf as K, her best friend as A, and our other friend as J. 

Title says most of it, (22m) don't want to get too into detail about the whole situation, but essentially the other day A (22f) told K (24) and I some rude things that another friend, J (19m) had been saying about our relationship. 
I didn't take it very hard because it was moreso directed at her, but K was understandably very upset by it all. 

A and consoled her and talked about it, and ultimately decided that at least for a little bit it would be best for her not to talk to J.
A also tried to drag J's sister (22f) into being in the guilty party even though she had nothing to do with it for seemingly no reason.
I said this wasn't fair, and that J's sister is innocent until proven guilty, to which A responded with calling me a ""fuckin lawyer"" in a way that sounded like a joke but you could tell she didn't like. 

She then continued about how her intuition is telling her that J's sister would definitely be part of the problem and then we more or less moved on. 
We all moved on after and just sort of accepted that J wasn't as good of a person as we thought.
That was until he came over to talk to me privately yesterday. 

He said his side of the story, even showed me screenshots of his conversation with A, and it all became very clear that A had actively been lying to make him seem much worse than he was. 
What's even worse is A knows how anxious K gets, and she knows better than anyone that embellishing everything J ""said"" would only make her spiral, overthink and feel self conscious about mine and her's relationship.

So essentially now just don't know what to do, K and A have known eachother much longer than I've been dating K, and they're eachothers best friends and roommates. 
I don't want to upset K, and I really don't want to come off like im trying to drive a wedge between them, but it scares me that this is her closest friend.

I'm even more stressed at the thought that if K wholeheartedly believes A over me that it's going to cause a big problem in our relationship or potentially end it, but can't not talk to her about it because can tell it's going to be a problem down the road, and she deserves to know if her ""friend"" is deliberately making her life worse. 

So if anyone has any advice on how to approach K about this that would be greatly appreciated.",0,My (22m) girlfriend's (24f) best friend (22f) has been actively sabotaging my gfs other friendships and our relationship.,r/relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,1,1,1.0,1,1,{},1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,8862685,1682446390,0,1682446405,1682446406,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,18,499

We are very intense and have both said we think this relationship could be the one and last forever, never felt like this before etc. Is the fact he hasn’t even mentioned the possibility of us living together soon a sign he isn’t as serious as he makes out?

relationship_advice,"We have been friends for over a year. I did notice him being a little more sensitive than i was from the begging and i was careful not to hurt him accidentally. But honestly, over time it has gotten very stressful keeping up with this constant need to be on gaurd. 
He gets upset over me talking to this one guy, say A, from our class. It got to the point where my friend would ignore me, walk away or act out whenever A is around. He even gets angry when i hang out with A seperately and tries to guilt trip me by asking why i don't come out to hangout with him when i can conveniently do that with this other guy. Once he even asked me to cancel an already fixed meet with A because he wanted to hang out with me instead. When i stood my ground and said no, he got upset again claiming he would have happily cancelled any meeting to see me. I know he would have done that but i really didn't think that's how a healthy relationship worked. 

He further does not understand the fact that i get drained very easily when I'm out and i often need a lot of alone time to recharge. He wants to hang out with me all the time, failing to do which makes him question my intentions as a good friend. In a lot of occasions, i just hung out with him even though i did not want to just so he would be happy or because this would have been an overcompensation on my behalf because he was already upset i hung out with A (or any other friend or did something else he did not agree to). 
When we do hangout, it's almost always me putting up a show for him. We have no common interests, nothing that i love interests him. He doesn't come up with anything nice to say except having brain dead conversations which we have already had a hundred times before or agrues with me. When i do remain silent, which i generally prefer, he bombardse with so many questions (which don't even seem to come from a place of concern) that i would just rather talk and entertain him. I'm very tired of this whole situation to the point where i feel exhausted to go to classes because he is in almost all my classes. I even started skipping a few. I also have started lying instead of honestly just saying I cannot make it because he would not understand and would assume i just don't want to hang out. I lie that I'm extremely sick or i just slept and did not hear his calls, which isn't true and it hurts me when i do it because i am just not that sort of person who wants to lie to their friends.
I tried communicating all of this to him on various occasions but for some reason there is no way I can reach him or make him understand what i am going thought on a daily basis. He just seems to care about one part of it, that he hurt me and filters out everything else that i have to say and would again be hurt about the whole situation. 
I also need to add that he helps me a lot. A bit too much to the extend where it would upset him if i said i could do certain things on my own. He holds this up against me everytime I tell him what he's doing is hurting me. It just makes me feel guilty and feels like i am using him for my own good. 
I feel very lost here and i feel like all the joy in my life has been sucked out. Don't get me wrong, i really want to be a nice friend to him but i just can't understand him or why he is doing what he is doing. When he's nice, he's a very good friend.
 I'm sorry for this long script, i just had too much going on and i really wanted to let it out, making sure you have a picture of the whole situation.

relationship_advice,"Hello (sorry in advance for the long text and my bad english)

I left my boyfriend a few days ago and I need advice.

My boyfriend and I had been together for 8 months. The problem is that he is very touchy. When I try to blame him for something, he gets mad and says he's useless and he should die. Let me explain :

1. He rages a lot when he plays video games. And that really scared me. At first, he said he was going to make an effort. Then nothing changed and I just blamed him. One day, I said to myself that I was going to write him a long text explaining to him that this side of him made me very uncomfortable and he ended up saying that ""I don't want to understand him, that we better break up, that I don't see the effort he's making..."" and when he blocked me on discord, he started sending me messages on instagram saying that he was going to commit s\*\*cide because he was useless. I spent the night ""comforting"" him and the rage problem was still there but I ended up not telling him anymore. I specify that he does not want to see a psychologist (even if I told him that I was going to pay for the first sessions)

2. He doesn't work. He spent his day on the pc, literally. I tried to tell him that it had to change but he said that it was useless because he was good for nothing. I dared not ""boost"" him for fear that he would take it badly.

3. I always felt bad around him. I don't know why at all. I constantly, constantly had a lump in my stomach. My mother used to tell me that I always looked sad when I was with him. I never knew why. I guess it's because he contradicted me all the time. I usually am quite talkatively, but I spoke very little with him. I reassured myself by saying that he was perhaps like a ""safe place"", but deep down I knew that I was lying to myself. He's not the kind of person I wanted to discuss anything and everything with. I was afraid that he would contradict me and break my mood. I figured it would go away with time. (weird, doesnt it ?...)

4. We had tried to live together, but he spent his day on the computer and he didn't do much at home. I had to ask him to do something every time, and most of the time he forgot to do it. And this is where the problem comes in:

The vagaries of life meant that I had to return to my parents and he to his. We saw each other often. I was trying to boost him to find a job but he couldn't because ""he was too dumb"". (taking his words) I started to despise him (it's awful, I know, really.) Once when he was having one of his many s\*\*icide tantrums, he said he was in a hurry to live again with me, and I told him that ""i'm afraid to live again with him because we are not the same about household (I'm manic and he's not) and he told me that he wants to live with me for his mental state and all I can think of is to talk about housework""... (maybe I should have talked about it another time but it would surely have been the same)

&amp;#x200B;

However, I was accepted in a nice profesionnal training in another city, which means that I have to get myself an apartment. And when I told him that, he immediately internalized the idea that he was going to live with me again. I had to tell him that I wanted to live alone, first because I like living alone, and second because we were not on the same wavelength concerning the household. That's what I did. I prayed that he wouldn't take it badly but... He told me that I ""didn't like him"", ""that he didn't want to try to understand me""... the conversation lasted long until he told me he ""deserved to die"". It was too much. Too much. I couldn't take this anymore.

I told him that between us it was over. He told me that ""he had just warned his family abt our breakup so that there was no turning back"". I notified mine as well. (once I notify my family, it's over.) I blocked him from everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

He came back few days after, telling me that ""he's sorry"" ""he's gonna change"", that ""he reacted under the influence of incomprehension, anger and sadness""..

I explained to him one last time that it was over. That I couldn't stand the fact that he threatened to kill himself every time I blamed him for something. That he says all the time (almost every night) that he's a human sh\*t that's useless and that he deserves to hang himself, that he should have thought twice before writing me those nasty words. I blocked it again, this time a bit sad.

I just turned on my pc for the first time in a while and it sent me tons of messages on steam. Telling me that he hopes with all his soul that this story is not over, that he loves me so much, that he promises to change, that he does not understand my reaction to block him from everywhere just for this little mess. It makes me sad. On the one hand, I want to distance myself from people like that (threat of s\*icide, always negative, sensitive) but on the other hand I tell myself that he can change. That he didn't choose to be depressed and touchy.

He's devastated, I'm sure. But me, I felt really light when we broke up. But yet, I'm still really attached to him since his messages really hurt me. I left him all alone. He is convinced that this story is not over and that I ""just sulk"".

I really need advice, did I make the right decision? Why didn't I feel like talking about everything when I was with him? (yet it's normal in a couple, isn't it?) Am I mean and  SELFISH to have abandoned him when he was depressed? Why did I feel so sick to my stomach with him?

These questions may not have an answer but it did me a world of good in any case to have written his words and shared them.
