    "#### Methods\n",
    "The original datasets were imported and cleaned using the Python Data Analysis Library (pandas) to ensure the findings would be accurate and to prevent any issues with analysis. The datasets were saved as new datasets following data cleaning, and these dataframes were transformed a final time before being used for modeling with Scikit-learn. Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries during exploratory data analysis and following modeling to show correlations. Visualizations utilized to display the data include heatmaps, histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots. Conclusion and recommendations were given based on the findings of the analyzed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**In conclusion,** the Lasso regression model (compared to Linear and Ridge) was the most successful in predicting home sale prices, with a Root Mean Square Error of 26794.86 and an R2 of around 90%. This indicates that the predicted home prices are on average within $26,794.86 of the actual home price, with 90% of the variability of the sale price explained by the predictor variables (home qualities). The baseline Root Mean Square Error was 81999.94, and with the Root Mean Square Error of the Lasso model being less than a third of that, this shows that the model works better than the baseline. \n",

    "![Top 20 Qualities](./images/amescorr20.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the correlations between home qualities and sale price, **recommendations** for realtors wanting to help their clients would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Focus on the overall quality of the home, making sure any obvious repairs are completed before listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Adding extra square footage in living or garage space can increase value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Improving the quality of the kitchen can raise the sale price.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the home has a basement that you can easily walk through (80+ inches), this should be showcased in the listing. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Top 20 Coefficients](./images/amescoef.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the coefficients (increase in Sale Price based on one unit change in home quality), realtors can **recommend** homeowners to focus on the following areas to increase the sale price of their home:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gr Liv Area: Increasing the above ground living area in the home could lead to a significant increase in the sale price. ($27009 per increase)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Overall Qual: Improving the overall quality of the home, such as through renovations or upgrades, can also have a large impact on the sale price. ($11401 per increase in Overall Qual rating)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Neighborhood_NridgHt and Neighborhood_StoneBr: Being in a desirable neighborhood, such as Northridge Heights and Stone Brook, can also increase the sale price - if the home is located in one of these neighborhoods, this should be shown in the listing. ($6192 - 8462 increase based on neighborhood)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 1st Flr SF: Increasing the size of the first floor of the home can also have a positive impact on the sale price. ($7742 per increase)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Kitchen Qual: Improving the quality of the kitchen, through upgrades or renovations, can increase the sale price. ($6562 per increase in Kitchen Qual rating)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Bsmt Qual: If the home has a basement that you can easily walk through (80+ inches), this should be showcased in the listing. ($6343 increase)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Bsmt Exposure: Showcasing a basement that has an access to walk outside can increase the sale price. ($6343 increase) \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Garage Cars: Increasing the number of cars the garage can hold, through expanding or adding a garage, can also increase the sale price. ($5372 per car space increase) \n",
    "\n",
    "9. Exter Qual: Improving the quality of the exterior of the home, through renovations or upgrades, can also have a positive impact on the sale price. ($5343 per increase in Exter Qual rating) \n",
    "\n",
    "Realtors should consider these factors when guiding homeowners on where to invest their time and money in preparing their home to sell, as well as when choosing which home qualities to feature in a lisiting. \n",
